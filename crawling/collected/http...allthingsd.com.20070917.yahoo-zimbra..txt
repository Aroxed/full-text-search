2007 at 11:09 am PT Tweet Share Print Yahoo is set to make yet another
acquisition–this time of white-label open-source email provider Zimbra.
Sources close to the deal said that the Internet portal will pay $350 million,
considerably upward of its most recent valuation, for the email and calendar
provider. Backed by Benchmark Partners, Redpoint Ventures and Accel Partners,
San Mateo, Calif.-based Zimbra’s clients include Comcast, many ISPs and a
number of colleges. The Wall Street Journal’s Robert A. Guth wrote about the
company last year. In a post by Om Malik on his GigaOm blog, he noted: “The
Zimbra-built email client marries the email and calendaring applications with
visual voicemail, and eventually will tie into other Comcast triple-play
services.” Yahoo’s been on a bit of an acquistion roll of late, grabbing
behavioral ad network BlueLithium for $300 million earlier this month and news
aggregator BuzzTracker last week for $5 million. Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang
continues on his 100-day march–and now seems to be making a number of
interesting moves. The acquisition was within Yahoo Senior Vice President Brad
“Peanut Butter Manifesto” Garlinghouse’s unit. Yahoo is briefing reporters
today on the deal, but left BoomTown off the list. Big mistake, as it just
makes us cranky and bored! Tagged with: BlueLithium, BoomTown, Brad
