at 2:06 pm PT Tweet Share Print Well, Notflix is Netflix once more. The
company finally resolved the technology problem that crippled its ability to
mail DVDs to members for most of this week. As of this morning, all Netflix
(NFLX) distribution centers are operating normally, and the backlog of DVDs
that should have been shipped earlier is finding its way into the mail. “If a
member should have been shipped a disc Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, with
rare exception it will ship today (Friday),” the company explained. “As a
result, millions of our members will receive DVDs on Saturday, in time (we
hope) for some weekend movie enjoyment.” To make amends for the outage,
Netflix plans to apply a 15 percent credit to billing statements of members
whose DVD shipments were delayed. A welcome turn of events after an ugly week
that saw Netflix customers losing their patience and the company losing an
estimated $1.8 to $3.6 million in revenue each day because of the disruption.
