Out as Server Sales Rise 12.2 Percent August 22, 2008 at 10:19 am PT Tweet
Share Print Worldwide server sales rose 12.2 percent, year over year, to 2.3
million units, in the second quarter, declares research firm Gartner (IT) in a
note today, while revenue was up 5.7 percent for a total of $13.8 billion. The
main driver was the replacement of x86 servers, a trend that began in the
first quarter, notes Gartner, but the expansion of data centers backing Web
sites was also an important factor, as was growth in emerging markets. IBM
(IBM) held onto the top revenue spot, with 31.2 percent of revenue, up 11.5

and shekels fell to 27.6 percent from 28.4 percent on 3 percent revenue
growth. Read the rest of this post Tagged with: Barrons, data centers, Dell,
