Edition September 15, 2008 at 3:20 pm PT Tweet Share Print Cost-cutting is one
of my favorite subjects. We have quite a bit more to do.” — HP CFO Cathie
Lesjak, Sept. 10, 2008 When Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) CFO Cathie Lesjak said she
was fond of cost-cutting, she wasn’t kidding. On Monday HP announced plans to
cut 24,600 jobs over the next three years as it digests Electronic Data
Systems, the technology services giant it acquired for nearly $14 billion this
summer. The job cuts amount to about 7.5 percent of the combined company’s
total workforce, and most will come from EDS, whose bloated cost structure was
in need of a good trim. HP estimates $1.8 billion in annual cost savings once
the three-year program is completed. “I think most of you that follow us know
I am a big believer that having the most efficient cost structure directly
relates to your ability to scale and grow,” HP CEO Mark Hurd explained to
securities analysts. Incidentally, 24,600 sacked employees is a new record for
Mark Hurd, whose first big act as HP’s CEO was a restructuring that eliminated
some 15,000 jobs. [Image credit: jischinger] Tagged with: Cathie Lesjak, cost-
