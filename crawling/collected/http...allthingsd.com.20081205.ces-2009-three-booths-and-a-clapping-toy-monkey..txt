@JohnPaczkowski Recent Posts by John Paczkowski CES 2009: Three Booths and a
Clapping Toy Monkey? December 5, 2008 at 11:26 am PT Tweet Share Print If a
global manufacturer of computer hardware like Belkin’s not exhibiting at CES,
who is? I posed that question jokingly earlier this morning, but turns out
there’s a very real and ugly answer to it: Not Seagate (STX). Not Logitech
(LOGI). Not Cisco (CSCO). Not Philips. Not Yahoo. Obviously. And not Sanyo,
either. All six companies have abandoned plans to exhibit on the Consumer
Electronics Show floor. Like Belkin, they are all opting for the more intimate
and inexpensive floorspace of a Vegas hotel room. Said Seagate spokesperson
Woody Monroy, “We haven’t pulled out of CES…we’re just taking a different
approach.” Cisco offered this statement on the matter: On our Q1 FY ’09
earnings call on November 5 we announced that we will be reducing expenses for
FY09 by over $1B from our annualized expense run rate, given the challenging
macroeconomic environment. We are targeting reductions in travel and
discretionary-related expenses, including offsite meetings, outside services,
equipment, events, trade shows, prototypes, marketing and other activities.
Given this focus on reducing costs, we are modifying our participation in the
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2009. We have several
speakers presenting in the various CES sessions, and Cisco chairman and CEO
John Chambers will be delivering a keynote at the conference, as well. We are
focusing our CES presence on our direct customers, press and analysts in order
to create a more intimate event and reduce expenses. We look forward to an
exciting CES 2009 with multiple product announcements that will reinforce
Cisco’s consumer strategy. We remain committed to the consumer market, and we
believe our cost control focus at this time is appropriate. In support of our
CES presence, we will be utilizing Cisco’s world-class Web 2.0 collaboration
technologies, such as TelePresence and WebEx, to maintain essential customer
and partner communication. Cisco will have compelling demonstration areas and
meeting rooms in the Venetian hotel in Las Vegas as we have for the past
several years.” Tagged with: analysts, Belkin, CES, Cisco, collaboration,
