@JohnPaczkowski Recent Posts by John Paczkowski Chapter 11, in Which SGI Sells
Itself to Rackable April 1, 2009 at 10:00 am PT Tweet Share Print “Lately
Silicon Graphics Inc. has had the kind of upward momentum associated with the
hit movies produced with its whizzy high-powered work stations, like
‘Terminator 2: Judgment Day’ and ‘Jurassic Park.’ After the company
outperformed Wall Street’s earnings estimates last week and the stock jumped
15 percent, analysts scrambled to upgrade ratings and future earnings
forecasts.” — Silicon Graphics’ Hot Run Goes On, New York Times, 1994 Time
was, there was a Silicon Graphics (SGIC) workstation on every desk in
computationally-intense industries like chemistry and film production. No
longer. Cheap Linux boxes have rendered them obsolete and SGI, the company,
along with them. This morning, SGI, which recently endured a brace of layoffs,
filed for bankruptcy protection for a second time and sold itself to Rackable
Systems, which makes server and storage products for midsize and large data
centers, for $25 million in cash. “We have been working very hard to
strengthen our company, and today, we’ve taken another big step in that
direction,” SGI CEO Robert Ewald said in a statement that would make even the
most exuberant of SGI-optimists wince. “This transaction represents a
compelling opportunity for Silicon Graphics’ customers, partners and
employees, who can all benefit from the emerging stronger company with better
technologies, products and markets [sic] reach.” A sad ending for SGI, which
really reinvented computer graphics and made quite a name for itself in the
high-performance computing space back in the day. Tagged with: bankruptcy,
