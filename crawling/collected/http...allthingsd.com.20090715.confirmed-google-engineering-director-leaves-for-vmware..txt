Chair Hit You on the Way Out… July 15, 2009 at 5:39 pm PT Tweet Share Print
“Prior to joining Google, I set up a meeting on or about November 11, 2004
with Microsoft’s CEO Steve Ballmer to discuss my planned departure….At some
point in the conversation Mr. Ballmer said: ‘Just tell me it’s not Google.’ I
told him it was Google. At that point, Mr. Ballmer picked up a chair and threw
it across the room hitting a table in his office.” – Former Microsoft
Distinguished Engineer Mark Lucovsky “I’ve never thrown a chair in my life….By
and large I made a commitment nine years ago that I was not going to curse. I
know I’ve had one or two transgressions in nine years, but I made that
commitment to myself. Is that one of them? I don’t recall.” – Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer The rumors are true. Mark Lucovsky, the engineer whose departure
from Microsoft (MSFT) allegedly sent CEO Steve Ballmer into a paroxysm of
profanity and chair-tossing, has left Google (GOOG) for a new position at
VMware (VMW), the company has confirmed. Lucovsky, once a Microsoft
Distinguished Engineer and a key architect of Windows and the company’s ill-
starred Dot-Net strategy, was hired away by Google in 2004. Now, five years
later, he has unceremoniously left the search sovereign for a senior engineer
position at VMware. There, he’ll be reunited with Paul Maritz, president and
CEO of VMware, who once served as Vice President of the Platform Strategy and
Developer Group at Microsoft. Tagged with: chair, curse, digital, Dot-Net,
