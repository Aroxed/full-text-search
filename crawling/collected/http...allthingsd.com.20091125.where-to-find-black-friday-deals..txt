Say Hello Marisa Taylor, Reporter, The Wall Street Journal Where to Find Black
Friday Deals November 25, 2009 at 11:03 am PT Tweet Share Print The day after
Thanksgiving is one of the biggest shopping days of the year and marks the
official beginning of the holiday retail season. So where can you find the
Black Friday deals? Google (GOOG) the term and a host of compilation sites pop
up, many of which began posting information a month ago to alert customers to
the best deals. Black Friday Ads, for example, publishes daily updates
featuring the best deals on electronics across the Web. SlickDeals.net
categorizes offers by retailer, including major ones like Amazon.com (AMZN),
Best Buy (BBY), Macy’s and Target, and the number of deals available at each
one. BlackFriday.info allows shoppers to create a Black Friday shopping list
and specifies which deals are online-only. Some sites offer a highly organized
look at what could otherwise be a jumble of information. DealsVista has
created a deals spreadsheet that can be viewed online or downloaded, and
Shoppers Shop created an online table of deals that includes start and end
dates. Read the rest of this post on the original site Tagged with:
