Aluminum Chassis, Q2 Ship Date January 8, 2010 at 1:17 pm PT Tweet Share Print
Here’s another heaping pile of grist for the Apple rumor mill: The company’s
Taiwanese manufacturing partners are said to be ramping up production of the
touchscreen panels and aluminum chassis intended for the tablet/slate computer
Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to uncrate at an as-of-yet unannounced special
event Jan. 27. Which means the mysterious device is likely to arrive at market
sometime in Q2. “Production of the cases will begin in February, so everything
points to a second-quarter launch right now,” an unnamed source told Reuters.
“It doesn’t take that long for the company to assemble the PC together, but a
second-quarter shipment date is what we’re looking at now.” This isn’t the
first time we’ve heard such predictions. Last month, Oppenheimer & Co. analyst
Yair Reiner said his checks into Apple’s supply chain indicated that “the
manufacturing cogs for the [device] were creaking into action” with an eye
toward a spring launch. Additionally, sources this week told The Wall Street
Journal that Apple would ship a tablet device to customers in March. Tagged
