Posts by Peter Kafka Is YouTube Finally Ready to Turn a Profit This Year?
January 14, 2010 at 8:19 am PT Tweet Share Print Starting last summer, Google
executives have consistently promised that YouTube was close to becoming
profitable. When will that finally happen? This year, says Barclays analyst
Douglas Anmuth. He predicts that the video site will see revenue jump 55
percent, to $700 million, in 2010, and that it will “start contributing
positively” to the Google’s earnings. Why? Because YouTube is ginormous, of
course. But also because the company has become more sophisticated about
advertising. (Note that Google content guru David Eun said much the same thing
when I talked to him last month, specifically citing the Google’s integration
of DoubleClick). Here’s the relevant part of Anmuth’s note: Perhaps the main
take-away for Google’s display business is that in 2010 we believe YouTube
will start contributing positively to EPS. An improving advertising
environment certainly helps, but with YouTube monetizing more than 1 billion
video views every week, and with strong sell-out rates on its home-page from
larger advertisers–we note 90% of the top 50 Ad Age have advertised on
YouTube–we believe the site can profitably take share of the branded display &
video market. We project YouTube to generate $700 million in revenue in 2010,
up 55% Y/Y. Usage continues to grow. In November the total number of YouTube’s
videos viewed grew 139% to 12.2 billion in November and unique visitors grew
32% Y/Y to 129 million. As a comparison, Hulu, the second most popular video
site by videos viewed according to comScore, recording 923 million videos
viewed. Of course, the standard caveats that Google (GOOG) uses when people
generate less flattering estimates for YouTube also apply here. It’s very
difficult to get a handle on how many pages/views Google is selling and how
much it gets for each one. It’s also tricky to guesstimate how much Google is
spending to serve more than a billion video streams a day. So at best, this is
an educated guess. Still, it will be interesting to see if Google concurs with
Anmuth. We’ll hear from Eric Schmidt et al in a week when the company reports
fourth-quarter earnings. Tagged with: 2010, advertising, Barclays, branded
