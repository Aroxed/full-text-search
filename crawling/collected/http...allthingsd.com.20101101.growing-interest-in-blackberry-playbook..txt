PlayBook November 1, 2010 at 7:42 am PT Tweet Share Print Research in Motion’s
BlackBerry PlayBook tablet is still a ways off from market, but its mindshare
is beginning to grow following a recent and impressive live demonstration at
Adobe’s MAX conference. New data from ChangeWave shows a promising trend in
PlayBook purchasing intentions. The research house surveyed 3,108 consumers
with an eye toward determining tablet and netbook demand and found the
PlayBook to be the second most popular choice among respondents planning to
buy a tablet. Eight percent of respondents expressed interest in it. That’s
significantly less than the 80 percent who professed interest in the iPad,
which, predictably, claims a daunting lead, but it’s significantly greater
then the three percent who claimed interest in Samsung’s Galaxy tablet and the
two percent who said they’d like Hewlett-Packard’s forthcoming Slate. Which,
as RBC analyst Mike Abramsky notes, is promising. Extrapolating from that
eight percent figure, he estimates that RIM may sell as many as six million
PlayBooks in 2011 (calendar) to claim 13 percent of the market. Tagged with:
