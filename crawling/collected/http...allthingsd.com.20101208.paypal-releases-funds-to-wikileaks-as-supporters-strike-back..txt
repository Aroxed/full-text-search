Say Hello Tricia Duryee PayPal Releases Funds to WikiLeaks as Supporters
Strike Back December 8, 2010 at 3:29 pm PT Tweet Share Print PayPal has just
released the remaining funds in the account associated with WikiLeaks today,
after restricting access to the account last week, according to a PayPal blog
post. The release of funds follows a number of denial-of-service attacks
earlier this week that were aimed at the document-leaking site’s providers.
Most of the providers are now refusing to work with WikiLeaks after the U.S.
government accused it of being in possession of documents that were provided
in violation of U.S. law. Yesterday, WikiLeak’s founder Julian Assange was
arrested and denied bail in London. He’s accused of sexual misconduct in
Sweden. While PayPal is releasing the residual funds to WikiLeaks, it is not
reinstating the ability for it to receive donations. PayPal was caught up in a
brief media storm this morning, after PayPal’s VP of Platform Osama Bedier
gave the impression at LeWeb in Paris that PayPal had cut off access to
WikiLeaks because of direct pressure by the U.S. government. PayPal now wants
to set the record straight, and says that it reviewed its policies regarding
WikiLeaks after the U.S. Department of State publicized a letter stating that
WikiLeaks may be in possession of documents that were provided in violation of
U.S. law. The letter was published, and not sent to PayPal directly. “PayPal
was not contacted by any government organization in the U.S. or abroad. We
restricted the account based on our Acceptable Use Policy review,” writes
PayPal’s General Counsel John Muller. “Ultimately, our difficult decision was
based on a belief that the WikiLeaks website was encouraging sources to
release classified material, which is likely a violation of law by the
source.” Further, the company disclosed that twice before–in 2008 and
2009–PayPal reviewed and restricted the account associated with WikiLeaks “for
reasons unrelated to our Acceptable Use Policy. As soon as proper information
was received from the account holder, the restrictions were lifted.” PayPal
has been one of many providers that have been the victim of computer attacks,
where servers were inundated with traffic. A spokesperson told us that it
mostly affected the company’s blog site, and did not directly affect its
payments services. Other affected companies include MasterCard and Swiss bank
PostFinance, The Wall Street Journal reports. No one is yet claiming
responsibility for the attacks, but some say they are being organized by the
ad hoc “Operation Payback.” Tagged with: Acceptable Use, access, account,
