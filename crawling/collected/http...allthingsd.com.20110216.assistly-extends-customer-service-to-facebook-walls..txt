Posts by Liz Gannes Assistly Extends Customer Service to Facebook Walls
February 16, 2011 at 10:08 am PT Tweet Share Print When something breaks, we
users ask for help wherever we think we can find someone responsible. Or maybe
we just stand up on our social media soapbox and whine. Either way, Assistly
helps companies deal with our problems by providing a Web-based customer
service and support platform that combines more traditional methods like
email, chat and phone with Twitter and, as of today, Facebook. The idea is to
make support more efficient and coordinated. So now, if you post about your
problems on the Facebook walls of Assistly customers like 37signals, Vimeo,
Rdio, Grooveshark and even Twitter, you might get a quicker and better-
delegated response from employees there. (Though the new Assistly Facebook
option just rolled out today, so they may not be using it yet.) There are many
(so, so many) social media management tools, but Assistly is more competitive
with customer support providers like Zendesk. (Both Zendesk and Assistly
already offer Twitter support, but Assistly is first to offer Facebook.
Twitter itself uses Zendesk for customer support via email and Assistly for
customer support via tweet.) Assistly CEO Alex Bard and members of his team
have been working on customer support software dating back to 1996 with eShare
Technologies, followed by eAssist Global Solutions, founded in 1999. More
recently they made the Goowy widget analytics platform that was bought by AOL
in 2008. Their current company has raised about $5 million from investors True
Ventures and Social Leverage. For its own customers, Assistly starts at $39
per month per full-time user, but it also has an hourly rate so companies can
spread the responsibility for customer support across all their employees.
