Posts by Ina Fried Opera Mini Returns to GetJar, With App Store Removed April
1, 2011 at 3:30 am PT Tweet Share Print Independent app store GetJar is once
again offering Opera’s browser, albeit in a version that comes without a link
to Opera’s competing app store. GetJar pulled the app last month after Opera
built an app store of its own into the browser. At the time, GetJar said it
couldn’t afford to help support someone that was going after its core
business. GetJar is one of many companies in the business of connecting mobile
phone owners with the thousands of applications available for their device–a
space that is growing increasingly competitive through the entry of new
startups and big players, such as Amazon. Opera joined the fray last month,
building a store powered by one of those startups–Appia–into its browser. That
prompted its delisting by GetJar. However, GetJar said on Wednesday that Opera
Mini was returning to the store. “GetJar remains committed to offering
consumers the best possible content regardless of category, phone or
platform,” GetJar CMO Patrick Mork said in a statement. “Opera Mini has been a
great partner and one of our top apps for many years and our users will be
happy to have a bigger and better version of Opera Mini back in our store.”
Opera also said it was glad to be back. “I’m glad that Opera Mini is back in
the GetJar store,” Opera Executive VP Mahi de Silva said in a statement. “We
believe Opera should be everywhere and we love the fact that our fans will now
be able to download Opera Mini again from GetJar.” What neither side
highlighted (but both privately confirmed) is that the version of Opera Mini 6
available for free from GetJar lacks the direct link to the Opera Mobile Store
that GetJar found so irksome. An Opera representative said there was no money
changing hands as part of Opera’s return. Tagged with: App Store, app stores,
