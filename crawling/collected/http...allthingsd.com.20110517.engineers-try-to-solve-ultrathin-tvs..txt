Say Hello Evan Ramstad, Reporter, The Wall Street Journal Engineers Try to
Solve Ultrathin TVs May 17, 2011 at 12:00 am PT Tweet Share Print Ro Jae-song,
a materials science professor here, has spent the past eight years researching
a display technology called OLED, which is now used for some high-end
cellphone screens. Mr. Ro does contract research for South Korea’s two big
electronics makers, Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Co., on a
difficult problem: How to build OLED screens big enough for large televisions.
It’s one of the hot topics among display researchers and manufacturers who are
meeting in Los Angeles for the annual conference of the Society for
Information Display, or SID. More academic gabfest than trade show, engineers
will trot out their latest ideas for displays as small as sheet-like films
that roll up in a pen to as large as roadside billboards. Read the rest of
