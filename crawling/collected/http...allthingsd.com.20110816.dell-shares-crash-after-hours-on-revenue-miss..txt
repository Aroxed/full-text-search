August 16, 2011 at 1:36 pm PT Tweet Share Print Shares of Dell are down about
four percent in after-hours trading as it reported quarterly earnings that
reliably beat the consensus of analysts but sales that fell short of
expectations. While Dell’s per-share earnings were 54 cents, about five cents
ahead of the consensus, sales were $15.66 billion, a full $100 million shy of
what analysts expected. Worse, Dell said it expects revenue in the third
quarter to be “roughly flat” relative to the second quarter, which it said
would be consistent with typical seasonal patterns seen over the last two
years. There’s more: Dell slashed its sales growth outlook for the year. It
said it now expects revenue to grow in a range of one to five percent, down
from its previous range of five to nine percent. CEO Michael Dell tried to
reassure investors of an eventual turnaround in a statement: “We continue to
see great momentum in the high-growth areas of our business, which is a direct
reflection of the discipline and strong execution our global Dell team is
applying to help solve real-world challenges for our customers. We’re creating
efficiency across every step of the IT value chain and ultimately enabling all
customers — from home users to large businesses and government organizations —
to achieve the outcomes that matter most to them.” It wasn’t enough to calm
skittish investors: Dell shares initially fell as much as six percent on the
news, and are as of 1:25 pm Pacific Time trading down 4.2 percent, or 64
cents. Tagged with: Dell, earnings, enterprise, financials, IT, Michael Dell,
