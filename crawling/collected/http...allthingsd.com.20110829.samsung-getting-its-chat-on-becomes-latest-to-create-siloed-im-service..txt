Posts by Ina Fried Samsung Getting Its Chat On With Siloed IM Service August
29, 2011 at 6:37 am PT Tweet Share Print Not to be outdone, Samsung said on
Monday that it, too, will offer an instant messaging service so owners of its
phones can contact one another without having to use text messages. Samsung’s
service, to be known as ChatON, is the latest effort by a phone maker to
follow in the footsteps of BlackBerry Messenger. Apple has already announced
the iMessage service that will be part of the forthcoming iOS 5 operating
system update. Dedicated messaging services such as BlackBerry Messenger and
iMessage allow customers to bypass carrier SMS charges while also enabling
advanced features such as delivery confirmation and the ability to see when a
user is typing a reply. Although not the first to the game, Samsung has the
ability to link together a significant number of devices, pledging to
eventually offer the service on a range of smartphones, feature phones and
even PCs and tablets. The company is also adding some unique features,
including the ability to scribble a message, or to see with whom one
communicates the most. “With ChatON, Samsung has vastly simplified mobile
communication by allowing users to connect to our upcoming feature phones and
all major smartphones in the market,” Samsung’s Ho Soo Lee said in a
statement. Over the weekend, Samsung also announced new tablets and phones
supporting LTE networks, and is expected to at long last bring its Galaxy S II
phone to the U.S., with a launch event slated for Tuesday in New York. It was
originally slated for Monday night, but the event was pushed back a day
because of Hurricane Irene. Tagged with: Apple, BlackBerry, Blackberry

reviews » Just as the atom bomb was the weapon that was supposed to render war
obsolete, the Internet seems like capitalism’s ultimate feat of self-
destructive genius, an economic doomsday device rendering it impossible for
anyone to ever make a profit off anything again. It’s especially hopeless for
those whose work is easily digitized and accessed free of charge.— Author Tim
