Posts by Liz Gannes Apple Hasn’t Sold So Few iPods Since 2005 October 18, 2011
at 1:51 pm PT Tweet Share Print Sales of Apple’s iPod continue to decline in
the face of the growth of its newer product lines. Apple sold 6.62 million
iPods in its fourth quarter of 2011, a 27 percent decline on the year. The
last time Apple sold so few iPods was in the third quarter of 2005, when it
sold 6.16 million. Quarterly iPod sales peaked in the first quarter of 2009 at
22.7 million. Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer said that the iPod Touch accounted
for more than half of iPods sold in the quarter. The company did, however, see
year-over-year increases in sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs. Tagged with:
