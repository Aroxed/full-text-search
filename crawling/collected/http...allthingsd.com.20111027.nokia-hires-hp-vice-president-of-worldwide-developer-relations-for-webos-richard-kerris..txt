Kerris Flees to Nokia October 27, 2011 at 7:45 am PT Tweet Share Print Another
talent loss for Hewlett-Packard’s webOS team. Richard Kerris, VP of Worldwide
Developer Relations for the division, has left the company for a new gig as
Nokia’s Global Head of Developer Relations. “Great people are what makes the
difference, always,” Marco Argenti, senior VP of Nokia’s Developer and
Marketplace division said in a tweet announcing the hire. “I’m excited to
welcome Richard Kerris in my team as Global Head of Developer Relations.” In
his new position, Kerris will oversee Nokia’s entire mobile portfolio, with
Windows Phone obviously being the biggest priority. Kerris officially left HP
on October 24 after just under nine months on the job. Given the breadth of
his involvement in promoting it, his departure is certainly another blow to
webOS and HP’s Palm division, which sacked about 525 employees back in
September. Tagged with: Hewlett-Packard, HP, Industry Moves, Microsoft, Nokia,

doomsday device rendering it impossible for anyone to ever make a profit off
anything again. It’s especially hopeless for those whose work is easily
digitized and accessed free of charge.— Author Tim Kreider on not getting paid
