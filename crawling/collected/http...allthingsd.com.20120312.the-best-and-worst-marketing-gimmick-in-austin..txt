Posts by Ina Fried The Best (And Worst) Marketing Gimmick in Austin March 12,
2012 at 8:00 am PT Tweet Share Print As I walked from the Austin Convention
Center, I noticed that nearly every car had an envelope under the wipers,
marked “Parking Violation.” Suspecting this might be a South by Southwest
gimmick rather than meter enforcement, I grabbed one of said envelopes.
Indeed, opening the envelope revealed a postcard with a quarter taped to it
and a pitch for a start-up called ParkMe. “Download the Parkme app today,” the
flyer said, in all capital letters, below the also fully capitalized “Parking
violation warning.” I wonder how many car owners fell for it, and just how
forgiving they were upon learning they had been played. RELATED POSTS: The
