More to Help You Judge Yourself (Video) August 28, 2012 at 10:00 am PT Tweet
Share Print On-the-job personal productivity start-up tenXer has raised $3
million in a Series B round, which it said it will use to accelerate growth
outside its software industry market. The San Francisco company, which was
founded by longtime entrepreneur Jeff Ma, makes tools to allow a user or
perhaps a company, track performance and progress using a number of different
metrics. The presumable goal is to use social and gaming elements, along with
this activity data, to help you do your job 10 times better. Get it with the
tenXer name now? The new funding is led by True Ventures, and its partner,
Puneet Agarwal, will join tenXer’s board of directors. Radar Partners and
Khosla Ventures, as well as angel investors, participated in the new round,
for what the company describes as a “human capital management platform.”
Currently aimed at tracking the work of software engineers, tenXer integrates
current tools such as GitHub, Pivotal Tracker and Jira. Here’s a video
interview with Ma — who gained fame for his gambling prowess as part of the
MIT blackjack team, and also was one of the co-founders of Citizen Sports,
which was bought by Yahoo in 2010 — about the new round, and also about where
tenXer is headed next: Tagged with: activity, angel, Blackjack, board,
