Autonomy Unit in the U.K. December 24, 2012 at 10:00 am PT Tweet Share Print
There are layoffs coming at Hewlett-Packard’s U.K.-based Autonomy software
unit, but not quite so many as a report in the Daily Mail suggests. That
newspaper reported today, in a thinly sourced story, that as many as 200
people were due to lose their jobs at the British software subsidiary in a
shake-up expected soon. Sources familiar with the company’s plans tell
AllThingsD that the number of jobs expected to be cut is actually fewer than
70; the cuts will focus on sales personnel, all of whom were originally hired
prior to HP’s acquisition of the company. Additionally, the job cuts were put
in motion in September, well before HP made public its intention to write down
the value of Autonomy by about $5 billion. Layoffs in European countries, like
those in the U.K., are more complicated to carry out, and so take months to
complete. In explaining the writedown, HP, which paid north of $11 billion for
Autonomy in 2011, alleged that the British company’s executives essentially
cooked the books in order to make Autonomy appear more valuable than it was.
It has reported its findings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
and the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office. Mike Lynch, the founder and former CEO of
Autonomy, has rejected HP’s allegations, and accused it of mismanaging the
company after the acquisition closed. RELATED POSTS: More From Mike Lynch:
