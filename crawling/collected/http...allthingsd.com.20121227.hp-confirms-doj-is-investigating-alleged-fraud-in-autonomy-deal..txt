Posts by Liz Gannes HP Confirms DOJ Is Investigating Alleged Fraud in Autonomy
Deal December 27, 2012 at 4:15 pm PT Tweet Share Print Hewlett-Packard said
today that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating its acquisition of
Autonomy, for which it is trying to write down about $5 billion in expenses
due to alleged “serious accounting improprieties.” The investigation
confirmation came as part of HP’s annual report filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. But this move was entirely expected given HP took its
case to the FBI/DOJ and the SEC in the United States as well as the Serious
Fraud Office in the U.K. HP said it was alerted by the DOJ on Nov. 21 that it
had officially opened an investigation about Autonomy. Former Autonomy CEO
Mike Lynch has strenuously rejected HP’s claims and has demanded to see
evidence for them. A spokesman for HP declined to comment on the matter.
