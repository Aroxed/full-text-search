Vulnerability January 7, 2013 at 2:56 pm PT Tweet Share Print If you’re seeing
a spike in people apologizing via their Facebook and Twitter feeds about how
their email accounts have been hacked in recent days, there’s a better-than-
average chance that the email account in question is on Yahoo Mail. Over the
weekend there was a lot of buzz about a cross-site scripting vulnerability
recently discovered in Yahoo Mail. It’s the subject of a story by TheNextWeb
that’s getting a lot of traffic today. The vulnerability was revealed by
Shahin Ramezany, a researcher at Abysssec, a small independent security firm.
According to his video demonstration, which you can see below (it’s hard to
see, so best to watch it in full-screen mode), the vulnerability is one of
those cross-site scripting, or XSS, vulnerabilities that work across multiple
browsers. Ramezany said via his Twitter feed that he will disclose more about
how the vulnerability works after Yahoo has patched it. But the vulnerability
is practically identical to another one that was documented in late November
and was seen being hawked on the Web by an Egyptian hacker known as TheHell
for an asking price of $700. Compare the two videos below. The first is from
Abysssec/Ramezany and runs about four minutes. The second was created by
TheHell, and it runs about 90 seconds. First, Abysssec: And now TheHell: They
certainly look similar to me. Anyhow, security journalist Brian Krebs notified
Yahoo about it on Nov. 12, which means that if indeed these vulnerabilities
are one and the same — not 100 percent certain, but tell me they don’t look
alike — then Yahoo has had nearly two months to try to patch it. It’s not the
first time Yahoo Mail accounts have been compromised in some manner. In July,
the company confirmed that some 450,000 user names and passwords were
compromised. They had come to Yahoo via its acquisition of Associated Content
in 2010 and had been stored on a server in plain text format. The news comes
less than a month after Yahoo unveiled a big redesign of its Yahoo Mail
service, which followed a fairly radical redesign of its home page. As of
December, Yahoo Mail was in third place behind Google’s Gmail and Microsoft’s
Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) as the most popular Web mail service. Yahoo
hasn’t said much about it yet and no one there has returned my calls, though a
Yahoo spokesman in the U.K. said the company is investigating the
vulnerability. Um, yeah. Tagged with: hackers, Mail, security, Yahoo, Yahoo
