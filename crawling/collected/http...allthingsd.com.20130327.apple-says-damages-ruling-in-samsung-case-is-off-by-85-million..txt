@JohnPaczkowski Recent Posts by John Paczkowski Apple Says Damages Ruling in
Samsung Case Is Off by $85 Million March 27, 2013 at 12:29 pm PT Tweet Share
Print Apple thinks it may have found an $85 million error in the ruling that
carved $450.5 million from the $1 billion in damages it won against Samsung
last year. In a new filing in its patent infringement case against Samsung,
Apple argues that two devices for which damages were vacated were actually
rightfully subject to the original $1 billion verdict. It asks U.S. District
Judge Lucy Koh to reconsider her post-trial ruling and reinstate $85.3 million
that a jury awarded it for patent violations related to Samsung’s Galaxy S II
and Infuse 4G. Tagged with Apple, Apple-Samsung, Judge Lucy Koh, lawsuits,
