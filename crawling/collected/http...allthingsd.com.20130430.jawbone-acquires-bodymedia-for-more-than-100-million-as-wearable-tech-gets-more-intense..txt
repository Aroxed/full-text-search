Million, as Wearable Tech Gets More Intense April 30, 2013 at 6:00 am PT Tweet
Share Print Looking to gain even more traction in the wearable health and
fitness market, Jawbone is snapping up another health product company. The Bay
Area-based private company has acquired BodyMedia, Inc., a 14-year-old
Pittsburgh-based company that makes health-monitoring armbands. The move comes
just a couple months after Jawbone, which makes the wearable Up fitness band
in addition to popular audio devices, acquired data and digital-design
companies Massive Health and Visere. Jawbone acquired BodyMedia for more than
$100 million, according to people familiar with the deal, although both
companies declined to give more specifics about the financials of the deal. So
what’s the appeal of BodyMedia for Jawbone? Unlike the Massive Health and
Visere buys, which were mainly for talent acquisition, BodyMedia’s value lies
in both the team and the company’s patents. BodyMedia has had more than 80
patents issued over the years, many in the area of multi-sensor technology. As
a combined entity, BodyMedia and Jawbone will have over 300 patents issued and
filed. While the $130 Jawbone Up wristband does many things — it tracks
activity levels and sleep patterns, and works with a compatible mobile app for
Android and iOS to log food consumption — it lacks some of the high-tech
sensors that BodyMedia’s products have. “I think the first phase of this
market has been about accelerometers and what those can do,” Jawbone CEO
Hosain Rahman said in an interview. “Now it’s about getting even more
granular, and also, how we can get all that tech into an efficient form
factor.” To that point, BodyMedia’s armbands, which will continue to be sold
for the time being, contain four different types of sensors, which measure
your skin temperature, heat flux, galvanic skin response (GSR) and overall
movement. But compared with the wristband form factor of the Jawbone Up, the
BodyMedia bands are bigger, bulkier products. Earlier this year, BodyMedia
introduced a slimmed-down version of its health-tracking band, called the Core
2, to compete in the growing category of barely noticeable, 24/7 wearable
fitness devices. So can we expect to see a Jawbone wristband with GSR sensors
anytime soon? “We’re working on lots of things,” was all Rahman would say,
adding, “We’re exploring where we would see sensors working, and how we can
put more and more on top of the body.” The BodyMedia team will stay in
Pittsburgh and will remain intact, both companies say. BodyMedia’s Chris
Robins will no longer serve as CEO of the company, and will instead become the
general manager of BodyMedia and a vice president of business development at
Jawbone. Jawbone also said today that it’s opening up its Up mobile software
to ten different fitness-app makers, including RunKeeper, MyFitnessPal,
LoseIt, Withings, Sleepio and IFTTT (for workout prompts). Jawbone Up users
with iOS devices will now be able to share data to and from these partner apps
with the Up app. Tagged with: acquisition, BodyMedia, Chris Robins, data,
