Posts by Mike Isaac Google+ Brings Story Suggestions to Mobile Web Publishers
May 13, 2013 at 6:30 am PT Tweet Share Print Google announced Monday that
publishers hooked into Google+ can use the social network to offer customized
story recommendations via the mobile Web. The new product suggests stories to
readers based on what’s relevant on a publisher’s site, or if a user is signed
in to their Google account, a story on the site that’s currently popular on
Google+. The idea, Google said, is to surface the most relevant content for
users, while recirculating more traffic for publishers. Tagged with Google,
