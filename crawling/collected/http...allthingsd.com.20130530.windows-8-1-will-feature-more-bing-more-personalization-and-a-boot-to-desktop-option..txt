Posts by Ina Fried Windows 8.1 Will Feature More Bing, More Personalization
and a Boot-to-Desktop Option May 30, 2013 at 6:00 am PT Tweet Share Print With
a forthcoming update, Microsoft will improve on the Windows 8 start screen
while also offering up a new option to bypass the tile interface and boot
directly to the traditional desktop. Windows 8.1, due out later this year,
will offer new options to personalize the lock and home screens, more deeply
integrated Bing search as well as a new version of the Internet Explorer
browser. Files can also be saved to Microsoft’s SkyDrive cloud storage
service. Microsoft has been dribbling out details about the free update,
previously code-named Windows Blue, since early this year. A preview version
is due next month at Microsoft’s Build developer conference. Although
Microsoft has sold more than 100 million licenses for Windows 8, the operating
system has come in for a fair share of criticism for its steep learning curve
and failure to reignite the PC market. Windows 8 is the company’s huge bet to
transition its desktop operating system into software that can power
everything from small tablets to giant, multi-screen computers using both
touch input as well as keyboard and mouse. The company bills it as a no-
compromise solution, but critics say it offers the best of neither world.
