6:39 pm PT Tweet Share Print Twitter on Friday updated the website for Twitter
Music, the company’s music discovery service, to better emphasize its charts

now, but I’d guess it’ll be coming to the mobile app soon enough. No word on
how well the service is doing since its launch in April. Tagged with apps,

bomb was the weapon that was supposed to render war obsolete, the Internet
seems like capitalism’s ultimate feat of self-destructive genius, an economic
doomsday device rendering it impossible for anyone to ever make a profit off
