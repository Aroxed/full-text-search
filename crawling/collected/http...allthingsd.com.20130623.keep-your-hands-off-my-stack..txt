complain it pays too much in royalties to make a profit. (Of course, we also

About Voices Along with original content and posts from across the Dow Jones
network, this section of AllThingsD includes Must-Reads From Other Websites —
pieces we’ve read, discussions we’ve followed, stuff we like. Six posts from
external sites are included here each weekday, but we only run the headlines.
We link to the original sites for the rest. These posts are explicitly
labeled, so it’s clear that the content comes from other websites, and for
clarity’s sake, all outside posts run against a pink background. We also
solicit original full-length posts and accept some unsolicited submissions.
