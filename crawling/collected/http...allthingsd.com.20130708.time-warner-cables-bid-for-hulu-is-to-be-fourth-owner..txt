Owner July 8, 2013 at 2:57 pm PT Tweet Share Print According to numerous
sources close to the situation, Time Warner Cable’s bid for Hulu is to be the
fourth owner of the premium video service. The other bidders for the service —
which has noisily been put on the block by its big media company owners, 21st
Century Fox (formerly News Corp.), Comcast and Disney — include: AT&T; in a
joint bid with former News Corp. COO Peter Chernin; Guggenheim Partners; and
DirecTV. Sources said that TWC would be a solution if there is a desire to
hold onto the property, with other bids hovering in the $1 billion range.
