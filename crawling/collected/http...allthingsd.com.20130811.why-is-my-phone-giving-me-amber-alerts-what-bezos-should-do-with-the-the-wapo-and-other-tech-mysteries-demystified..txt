Posts by Ina Fried Why Is My Phone Giving Me Amber Alerts, What Bezos Should
Do With the WaPo (And Other Tech Mysteries Demystified) August 11, 2013 at
1:54 pm PT Tweet Share Print Many Californians were jolted out of bed last
Monday to an unusual siren sound emanating from their smartphone, followed by
an Amber Alert about a suspected kidnapper. While the mobile phone warning was
new to those in the Golden State, the Emergency Alert System has been running
for about a year now (as faithful AllThingsD readers already knew), having
served up weather-related alerts for Hurricane Sandy and other East Coast
storms, as well as various regional Amber Alerts. AllThingsD’s Ina Fried
explained the system in an interview with Southern California Public Radio.
And, for those who missed it, law enforcement caught up with the suspect in
Idaho on Saturday, killing him and rescuing the teenager he kidnapped.
Meanwhile, Kara Swisher struck a chord this week with her essay advising Jeff
Bezos on what to do with the Washington Post. Swisher appeared on NBC’s “Meet
the Press” earlier on Sunday as part of a panel on what the blockbuster deal
means for the future of one of journalism’s most treasured institutions. Visit
NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy
Elsewhere, AllThingsD staffers talked about other topics: Walt Mossberg and
Katie Boehret appeared on The Wall Street Journal’s “Digits” program this week
to discuss their takes on the Moto X phone that was announced earlier this
month. Liz Gannes appeared on the WSJ Live’s News Hub talking about the latest
venture being backed by Tyra Banks, a photography-app maker called Flixel. The
International Trade Commission on Friday ordered an import ban against some
Samsung products, saying they infringed on two Apple patents. Ahead of that
ruling, Ina Fried appeared on CNBC to talk about the implications of the
Samsung-Apple case. Tagged with: Amazon, Amber Alert, Apple, Apple-Samsung,
