Ventures Builds Up Lobbying Troops August 27, 2013 at 11:09 am PT Tweet Share
Print Intellectual Ventures founder Nathan MyhrvoldIntellectual Ventures, the
invention-capital firm/patent troll founded by former Microsoft executive
Nathan Myhrvold, is ramping up its presence inside the Beltway. IV, which has
amassed thousands of patents over the past decade as part of its intellectual-
property licensing business, recently tapped telecom lobbyist Russell Merbeth
to establish an in-house lobbying team in Washington, D.C. Merbeth’s mandate,
according to his lobbying registration: To represent IV on issues related to
patent reform, intellectual-property rights, taxation of patent royalties and
corporate tax reform. An interesting, and inevitable, move for IV, whose
lobbying spending rose from $440,000 to $1,040,000 between 2005 and 2012. With
the Obama administration wading ever deeper into the debate over patent
litigation and rolling out policies intended to better regulate patent-holding
firms, opening a D.C. lobbying office is a wise move. As Merbeth, former vice
president of government affairs at Cricket Communications, told the Washington
Post, it’s time for IV to step up its game inside the Beltway. “Intellectual
Ventures has been active in Washington and after the America Invents Act was
passed, IV wanted to standardize its public policy operations regardless of if
there’s any legislation being considered at the moment,” Merbeth told
AllThingsD. “IV will continue to have a consistent presence here in Washington
to educate members of Congress and the administration.” Tagged with: Beltway,
