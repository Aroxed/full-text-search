Recent Columns by Walt Mossberg Mossberg’s Mailbox In Search of a Virtual
Keyboard App October 15, 2013 at 6:06 pm PT Tweet Share Print Q: I’m a former
BlackBerry user who has been struggling with the virtual keyboard on his Droid
for years. I considered the new BlackBerry, whose virtual keyboard you
praised, but want a phone supported by more app developers. I would appreciate
your advice on which keyboard app is easiest to operate now. A: The keyboard
app I personally find best on Android is called SwiftKey, which replaces the
stock keyboard on Android wherever it appears. It does a particularly good job
of learning your writing habits and predicting what word is likeliest to come
next. It can even sync these personal predictions across your Android devices.
Q: With iGoogle going away in a few weeks, what is your recommendation on a
good replacement site? A: There are a number of sites which, like iGoogle, aim
to be your browser’s home page, consolidating personalized selections of news,
weather, sports, stocks, calendar, search and more. My personal choice would
be My Yahoo, which even has instructions for importing your settings from
iGoogle. To find others, do a search for “iGoogle replacements.” Q: I don’t
like the redesigned calendar app in Apple’s iOS 7 for my iPad. Is there a way
to restore the old calendar? A: Not that I know of, but there are many
alternative calendar apps for iPads and iPhones, which can be found in the app
store by searching for “calendar.” Email Walt at mossberg@wsj.com. Tagged with
