Say Hello Tim Cook, CEO, Apple Workplace Equality Is Good for Business
November 3, 2013 at 6:10 pm PT Tweet Share Print Long before I started work as
the CEO of Apple, I became aware of a fundamental truth: People are much more
willing to give of themselves when they feel that their selves are being fully
recognized and embraced. At Apple, we try to make sure people understand that
they don’t have to check their identity at the door. We’re committed to
creating a safe and welcoming workplace for all employees, regardless of their
race, gender, nationality or sexual orientation. As we see it, embracing
people’s individuality is a matter of basic human dignity and civil rights. It
also turns out to be great for the creativity that drives our business. We’ve
found that when people feel valued for who they are, they have the comfort and
confidence to do the best work of their lives. Read the rest of this post on

original content and posts from across the Dow Jones network, this section of
AllThingsD includes Must-Reads From Other Websites — pieces we’ve read,
discussions we’ve followed, stuff we like. Six posts from external sites are
included here each weekday, but we only run the headlines. We link to the
original sites for the rest. These posts are explicitly labeled, so it’s clear
that the content comes from other websites, and for clarity’s sake, all
outside posts run against a pink background. We also solicit original full-
length posts and accept some unsolicited submissions. Read more » Featured
