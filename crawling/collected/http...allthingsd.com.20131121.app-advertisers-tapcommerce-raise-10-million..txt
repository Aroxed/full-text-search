Posts by Peter Kafka App Advertisers TapCommerce Raise $10 Million November
21, 2013 at 9:00 pm PT Tweet Share Print IPad and iPhone users have downloaded
60 billion apps. Android users have downloaded 50 billion. But just because a
bunch of people have downloaded your app doesn’t mean they’re going to use
your app. Hence a new ad market that has appeared in the past year: App
“engagement” ads, designed to get mobile users to re-open apps they’ve already
got on their gadgets. Facebook, which already makes a lot of money selling app
install ads, started rolling out engagement ads last month. Now TapCommerce, a
startup that only sells app engagement ads, has raised a $10.5 million Series
A round, led by Bain Capital Ventures and RRE Ventures. Earlier investors
Metamorphic Ventures, Eniac Ventures and Nextview Ventures, which had
previously put more than $1 million into the company, are back as well. App
retargeting/reengagement ads have the most obvious payoff for app makers who
sell stuff, and TapCommerce lists retailers like Fab, eBay and Jackthreads
among its customers. CEO Brian Long said his company places ads on phones and
tablets using nine mobile ad exchanges. The open question for app advertisers
is whether the market is a permanent one, or something that will deflate as
app publishers get a better handle on what their apps are really worth. The
other question for TapCommerce is how it’s going to play with Facebook, which
has found app advertising to be a surprisingly fruitful revenue stream. It
will be interesting to see if they want to let outsiders play along. Tagged
