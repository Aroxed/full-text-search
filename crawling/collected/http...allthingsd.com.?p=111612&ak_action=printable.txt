Mobile New AT&T; Customers to Face Tough Choice on Text Messages Published on
August 18, 2011 by Ina Fried AT&T; is doing away with its bundled text message
option, leaving new customers with two choices — pay $20 for unlimited texting
or shell out 20 cents each time their friend sends them a text message asking
“YT?” “Starting August 21, we’re streamlining our text messaging plans for new
customers and will offer an unlimited plan for individuals for $20 per month
and an unlimited plan for families of up to five lines for $30 per month,”
AT&T; said. “The vast majority of our messaging customers prefer unlimited
plans and with text messaging growth stronger than ever, that number continues
to climb among new customers.” Those already using a bundled plan — such as
the $10 for 1,000 text messages option — can keep their existing plan, even if
they change handsets, AT&T; said. The move comes as the U.S. has passed the
Philippines to become the most text message-addicted country, according to a
new report from wireless analyst Chetan Sharma. Americans now average about
664 messages per subscriber per month. That means, though, that the average
person here would still be better off with the $10 per month plan that AT&T;
is eliminating. AT&T;’s shift was reported earlier on Thursday by Engadget.
