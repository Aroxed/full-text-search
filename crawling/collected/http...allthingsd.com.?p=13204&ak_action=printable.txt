Media Bertelsmann Backs Away From Scoyo, Its Educational Kids Site Published
on November 23, 2009 by Peter Kafka German entertainment conglomerate
Bertelsmann, which made a move into the online kids/education market earlier
this year, appears to be having second thoughts. Bertelsmann is looking for an
investor to buy some or all of Scoyo, which it launched in Germany in January
of this year and previewed in the U.S. in September, the company confirmed via
email. It says that while it hunts for new money, it is keeping the German
site up and running but has put development of the U.S. site on hold “as it
will be a decision of the new investor how to deal with the US portal.” I’ve
been told that the company has invested as much as $30 million over two years
into the project, but Bertelsmann declined to comment on that figure. I’m not
in the target market, and I’d be unable to use Scoyo even if I were, as it
only runs on Windows machines. But here’s the way the U.S. site describes the
service: It is “targeted to the supplemental and homeschool markets, [and]
will deliver high-quality educational content for children in Kindergarten
through 8th grade across a variety of subjects and disciplines.” The beta is
free, and the site was supposed to launch a subscription service next year.
