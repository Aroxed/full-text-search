News Apple Hasn’t Sold So Few iPods Since 2005 Published on October 18, 2011
by Liz Gannes Sales of Apple’s iPod continue to decline in the face of the
growth of its newer product lines. Apple sold 6.62 million iPods in its fourth
quarter of 2011, a 27 percent decline on the year. The last time Apple sold so
few iPods was in the third quarter of 2005, when it sold 6.16 million.
Quarterly iPod sales peaked in the first quarter of 2009 at 22.7 million.
Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer said that the iPod Touch accounted for more than
half of iPods sold in the quarter. The company did, however, see year-over-
year increases in sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs. Return to: Apple Hasn’t
