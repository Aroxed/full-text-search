News The Best (And Worst) Marketing Gimmick in Austin Published on March 12,
2012 by Ina Fried As I walked from the Austin Convention Center, I noticed
that nearly every car had an envelope under the wipers, marked “Parking
Violation.” Suspecting this might be a South by Southwest gimmick rather than
meter enforcement, I grabbed one of said envelopes. Indeed, opening the
envelope revealed a postcard with a quarter taped to it and a pitch for a
start-up called ParkMe. “Download the Parkme app today,” the flyer said, in
all capital letters, below the also fully capitalized “Parking violation
warning.” I wonder how many car owners fell for it, and just how forgiving
they were upon learning they had been played. RELATED POSTS: The Homeless
