News Electronic Mirrors Sell Lipstick and a Makeover Published on August 27,
2010 by Christina Passariello Cosmetics aisles in supermarkets and drugstores
are adding electronic makeover specialists with the help of an Israeli start-
up. Retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), France’s Carrefour SA and
Superdrug Stores PLC in Britain are testing EZface Inc.’s “virtual mirrors” in
their stores to simulate what makeup and hair dye would look like on shoppers.
Faced with stiff competition from specialist cosmetics stores including
Sephora, where shoppers get to try on products before buying them, retailers
are looking for new ways to boost sales and reduce damaged inventory from
opened packaging by consumers experimenting with products. The virtual mirror
kiosks are designed to be easy to use. A person stands in front of the screen
and an internal camera takes a picture. Then the person scans the bar codes of
various cosmeticsâsuch as mascara, foundation, eye shadow, blush and lip
glossâand each automatically appears on the appropriate part of the face. A
list on the right side of the screen reminds the person what products she is
virtually testing. The user can print out the image, send it by email, or post
it on Facebook. Read the rest of this post on the original site Return to:
