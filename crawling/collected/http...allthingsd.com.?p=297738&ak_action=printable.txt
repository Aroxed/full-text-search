Media Mozilla to Block Third-Party Cookies in Firefox Published on February
24, 2013 by Mike Isaac The Mozilla Foundation, makers of the popular Firefox
Web browser, will begin to block third-party advertising cookies by default, a
move sure to upset online advertisers who rely on behavioral audience tracking
to better serve online ads. The move is in line with that of Apple’s Safari,
which has blocked third-party cookies for a long time, yet diverges from
Google’s Chrome browser, which allows cookies of all types. Return to: Mozilla
