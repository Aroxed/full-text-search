News Apple Uncrates New $1,099 Education-Only iMac Published on March 6, 2013
by John Paczkowski Without fanfare, Apple this week rolled out a new iMac, a
machine targeted at a market the company likes to say is “in its DNA”:
Education. The new machine features Apple’s latest iMac design, with leaner
specs that drop its price below that of the entry-level consumer iMac. It
boasts the same 21.5-inch display, but its innards are quite different: A
3.3GHz dual-core Intel i3 processor, instead of a 2.7GHz quad-core Intel Core
i5, four gigabytes of RAM instead of 8GB, and a hard drive with 500GB of
storage instead of one terabyte. At $1,099, the new education-only iMac is
$100 more than its predecessor. But it remains $150 cheaper than an entry-
level consumer iMac purchased with an educational discount. So, a reasonable
lower-price option for educators on tight budgets, though on its face the new
edu iMac might not seem the best value. Sure, you save $150, but you also end
up with a dual-core i3 instead of quad-core i5, and half the RAM and hard-
drive storage of the entry-level iMac. Of course, if you’re budget-constrained
and looking to trick out a computer lab with a row of new iMacs, it’s not
specs that you’re looking at so much as volume discounts. Return to: Apple
