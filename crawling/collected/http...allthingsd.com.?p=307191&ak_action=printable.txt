News Apple Says Damages Ruling in Samsung Case Is Off by $85 Million Published
on March 27, 2013 by John Paczkowski Apple thinks it may have found an $85
million error in the ruling that carved $450.5 million from the $1 billion in
damages it won against Samsung last year. In a new filing in its patent
infringement case against Samsung, Apple argues that two devices for which
damages were vacated were actually rightfully subject to the original $1
billion verdict. It asks U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh to reconsider her post-
trial ruling and reinstate $85.3 million that a jury awarded it for patent
violations related to Samsungâs Galaxy S II and Infuse 4G. Return to: Apple
