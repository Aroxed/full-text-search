Social Twitter Music Beefs Up Charts on the Web Published on June 1, 2013 by
Mike Isaac Twitter on Friday updated the website for Twitter Music, the
company’s music discovery service, to better emphasize its charts feature. The
new site features top categories like “emerging,” “popular” and “hunted,” as
well as breaking down music categories by genre. It’s a push to offer users
easier music discovery and navigability. Charts are Web-only right now, but
I’d guess it’ll be coming to the mobile app soon enough. No word on how well
the service is doing since its launch in April. Return to: Twitter Music Beefs
