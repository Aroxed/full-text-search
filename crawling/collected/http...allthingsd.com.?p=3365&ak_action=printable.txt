News Notflix, Redux Published on August 15, 2008 by John Paczkowski Well,
Notflix is Netflix once more. The company finally resolved the technology
problem that crippled its ability to mail DVDs to members for most of this
week. As of this morning, all Netflix (NFLX) distribution centers are
operating normally, and the backlog of DVDs that should have been shipped
earlier is finding its way into the mail. “If a member should have been
shipped a disc Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, with rare exception it will
ship today (Friday),” the company explained. “As a result, millions of our
members will receive DVDs on Saturday, in time (we hope) for some weekend
movie enjoyment.” To make amends for the outage, Netflix plans to apply a 15
percent credit to billing statements of members whose DVD shipments were
delayed. A welcome turn of events after an ugly week that saw Netflix
customers losing their patience and the company losing an estimated $1.8 to
$3.6 million in revenue each day because of the disruption. Return to:
