Mobile Spanish Startup Offers a Low-End Take on High-Tech Glasses Published on
October 16, 2013 by Ina Fried Santiago Ambit loves the idea of adding
technology to eyeglasses, but not the notion of having to walk around looking
like something out of a science fiction movie. The Spanish entrepreneur wants
to take a modest amount of technology to handle things like basic remote
control and notifications and put it into a package small enough and
inexpensive enough to rival traditional specs. “The idea is to fight with
regular glasses, not Google Glass,” Ambit said, trying on the prototype of the
specs. “With [these] you don’t look like a cyborg.” His 12-person firm has
created Ion Glasses, a $79 pair of eyewear that aims to be on the market early
next year. It has just the basics — bluetooth for communicating with an
Android or iOS device (or Mac or PC), a micro-USB port for charging, LED and
buzzer for notifications and a pair of buttons for controlling a camera
sensor. Ion has gone from a prototype the size of a slice of toast a year ago
to a near-production-ready size as of March. The company is taking backers on
Indiegogo (they have reached a little more than half of their $60,000 goal)
with an eye toward shipping the first glasses in February. Return to: Spanish
