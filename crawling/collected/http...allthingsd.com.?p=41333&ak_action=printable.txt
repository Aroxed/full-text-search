Social Facebook and Twitter Coming to Kindle–In Glorious Black and White
Published on May 24, 2010 by John Paczkowski Amazon (AMZN) pledged to deliver
its Kindle 2.5 firmware update in late May, and now that the month is nearing
its end, the company is rolling it out as promised. As a point release, itâs
a nice little update, with a new password-protection feature that locks the
device when it’s in sleep mode and social networking integration that allows
for the sharing of book excerpts via Facebook and Twitter. But as an effort to
make the Kindle more competitive with some newly arrived and formidable
rivals, it falls a bit short. [Image credit: Ars Technica] Return to: Facebook
