Enterprise Microsoft Suit Against Salesforce Just Got Ugly Published on
February 11, 2011 by Arik Hesseldahl Last month, Microsoft sued Salesforce.com
over the latter’s hiring of Matt Miszewski. Once the CIO for the state of
Wisconsin, he had most recently been head of Microsoft’s government business,
and on Jan. 18 was tapped as senior vice president for global public sales at
Salesforce. Microsoft sued to block the hiring less than 10 days later. The
court issued a temporary injunction preventing Miszewski from going to work at
Salesforce. It just got ugly. Microsoft has accused Miszewski (pictured) of
taking several hundred megabytes worth of confidential material when he left.
It said in a motion filed with Washington state’s King County Superior Court
on Thursday that Miszewski had about 600 megabytes worth of confidential
material on his personal computer. The documents were found as part of the
discovery process. Microsoft Dynamics Online competes directly with
Salesforce.com in the cloud-based customer relationship management business.
They grappled in federal court last year over patents, but settled. Neither
side is commenting on the Miszewski case. Return to: Microsoft Suit Against
