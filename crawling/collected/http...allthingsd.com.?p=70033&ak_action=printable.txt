News Are You a Betty or a Veronica? Published on October 9, 2009 by Kara
Swisher Like a lot of fans of the “Archie” comic book series–yes, BoomTown is
that old–I was irked when Riverdale’s endless teen goofball picked spoiled
Veronica over sweet Betty in a recent issue in August. Not because I like
Betty more, but because it ended the long-running love triangle that has been
going for almost 70 years. But apparently, the story is not over, according to
a piece this week in the New York Times, because the whole thing is part of a
six-story arc, which includes Archie marrying both Veronica and Betty and
having twins with each. Well, not at the same time, so get your minds out of
the gutter. Using the trick of Archie going down different paths on Memory
Lane, he first marries Veronica and has the kids in two issues. Then, going
down a different path, he marries Betty in the November issue and has more
kids in the next two issues. Presumably, the last two will have the carrot-
haired hero finally decide. Personally, I am voting for Jughead. In any case,
Archie Comic Publications actually has a nice digital site, where you can read
comics online or even on an Apple (AAPL) iPhone. And here are the competing
covers: Return to: Are You a Betty or a Veronica? URL:
