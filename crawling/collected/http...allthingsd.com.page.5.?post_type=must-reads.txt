Along with original content and posts from across the Dow Jones network, this
section of AllThingsD includes Must-Reads From Other Websites — pieces we’ve
read, discussions we’ve followed, stuff we like. Six posts from external sites
are included here each weekday, but we only run the headlines. We link to the
original sites for the rest. These posts are explicitly labeled, so it’s clear
that the content comes from other websites, and for clarity’s sake, all
outside posts run against a pink background. We also solicit original full-
length posts and accept some unsolicited submissions. Read more » Featured
