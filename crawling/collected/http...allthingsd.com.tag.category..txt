More Yahoo Ad Reorg Details Kara Swisher in Media on January 7, 2013 at 12:41
pm PT I just got some more deets of the Yahoo advertising reorganization by
COO Henrique De Castro, which started taking place last week. As I previously
reported, it’s a major shift of sales staff to a “category” model rather than
one that is regional and tiered. Sources say that Mark Ellis, who has been VP
of North American sales and global partnerships, still has a similar title,
but now has a job with more responsibility and influence. Interestingly, Peter
Foster, who has headed audience advertising, is now in charge of new sales
enablement group, which includes sales engineering and training, as well as
the mid-market segment. Both will apparently report up to another exec, who is
still to be determined. Yahoo’s De Castro Begins Reorg of Ad Sales Unit Kara
