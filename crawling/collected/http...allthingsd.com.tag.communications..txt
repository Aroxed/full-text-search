Swisher in News on October 29, 2013 at 4:09 pm PT Microsoft has named Gurdeep
Singh Pall to replace the departing Mark Gillett as corporate VP for Skype, as

value creation at private equity firm Silver Lake, had been responsible for
Skype’s product, engineering and operations worldwide, duties that will now

Top Skype Exec Mark Gillett Departs Microsoft Kara Swisher in Media on October
28, 2013 at 6:45 am PT According to an internal memo sent this morning to
employees, top Skype exec Mark Gillett is leaving Microsoft. Sources said that
Gillett — who is corporate VP for Skype, as well as its Lync product — has
another job he is headed to, although the memo did not mention where he was
going. Gillett, who is responsible for Skype’s product, engineering and
operations globally, has been with the online telephony company for several
years, including before Microsoft bought it. Previous to that, he worked at
private equity giant Silver Lake in Europe. Voices Director Says BlackBerry

Byte Xobni’s Jeff Bonforte Officially Running Yahoo’s Communications Products
Kara Swisher in News on August 28, 2013 at 12:39 am PT According to his
LinkedIn profile, Jeff Bonforte has been named SVP of communication products
at Yahoo. An insider tipped me to the new title for the former CEO of Xobni,
the maker of address-book apps and plugins which Yahoo bought in July. “I have
responsibility for Yahoo Mail, Messenger, Groups, Contacts, Calendar and some
other stuff,” wrote Bonforte on his profile helpfully (to me!). AllThingsD had
previously reported that the well-regarded former Yahoo was likely to get just
this key portfolio at Yahoo, which could certainly use his expertise. Battery
