gaming-specific handhelds is Sony’s PlayStation Vita, which has historically
lagged behind the 3DS in sales. Microsoft’s Xbox 360 sold 140,000 units in
June, while Sony has not disclosed how many PS3s it moved. News Byte Nvidia

Lauren Goode in News on February 22, 2012 at 5:53 am PT Sony’s new handheld
gaming product, the PlayStation Vita, goes on sale today in Europe and the
U.S. Following its initial launch in Japan in December, the device was plagued
