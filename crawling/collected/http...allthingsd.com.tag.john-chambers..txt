the script was that it captured that time period, when it was such a specific
moment in our recent history. The dot-com bubble had already burst in March of
2000 and continued to plummet through that summer. It had been crashing for a
while, yet there was still this strange sense that it was going to turn
around. It was this really surreal time that somehow seemed to be lasting
longer than it deserved, and then 9/11 happened and everything changed. It is
a period of our history that hasn’t been examined because the events of 9/11
overshadowed that.— Austin Chick, director of “August,” a film about the chief
executive of a Silicon Alley dot-bomb in August 2001 AllThingsD by Writer Walt
