Say Hello Speaker Léo Apotheker President and CEOHewlett-Packard Company
Apotheker is an international tech figure who is aiming to turn giant HP into
a company that marries its hardware to its own operating system, webOS, which
it acquired in buying Palm. This could make the company look more like Apple
and less like Dell, at least in the consumer space. Prior to joining HP,
Apotheker spent 20 years at SAP, where he was integral in helping build the
company into one of the world's leading providers of enterprise software. He
was also the founding president and COO of ECsoft BV, one of the largest
European venture capital start-ups. Apotheker was born in Aachen, Germany and
graduated with a B.A. in economics and international relations from Hebrew
University, Jerusalem. He is fluent in English, Dutch, French, German and
Hebrew and has been awarded the French Légion d'honneur. Posts With Léo
