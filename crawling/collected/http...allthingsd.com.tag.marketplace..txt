News Byte Social-Shopping Website OpenSky Relaunches as Full-Fledged Online
Marketplace Lauren Goode in Commerce on May 1, 2013 at 4:00 am PT OpenSky, the
two-year-old e-commerce site that took a stab at social shopping by allowing
members to follow celebrity and expert curators, has relaunched as a full-
fledged marketplace for small businesses. Merchants can open up their own
“stores” on the site for free, and can sell to OpenSky’s 2.5 million members,
with OpenSky taking a commission on items sold — like Etsy, but with a social
twist, more established sellers and a much smaller community of shoppers.
Items listed range from cosmetics to clothing to kitchen supplies. OpenSky is
based in New York and has raised nearly $50 million in venture capital funding
to date. Eventbrite Hires CFO in Expansion of Top Exec Ranks Kara Swisher in
