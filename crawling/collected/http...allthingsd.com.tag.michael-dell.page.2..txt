Say Hello Speaker Michael Dell Chairman and CEODell One of the giants of the
PC industry, Michael Dell founded his namesake company in 1984 with $1,000 and
the brilliant idea of selling a complicated product directly to customers,
both businesses and consumers. In 1992, Mr. Dell became the youngest CEO ever
to earn a ranking on the Fortune 500, and Dell eventually became the world's
largest seller of personal computers. But, after stepping down as CEO a few
years ago, Mr. Dell was forced to resume the role in 2007 after changing
market conditions caused the company to falter. Average consumers, never
Dell's core audience, became more important, as did retail sales. And Dell has
been scrambling to compete with the likes of Apple, HP and Sony in areas like
design and technical innovation, which have become more important. Posts With

and Mila Kunis (that’s what Tove says, I was oblivious – it’s those famous
geek social graces again. I told her I’m sure I’d have noticed Natalie Portman
and that she can’t possibly have been there, but whatever), and Tove pissed
off Warren Beatty by asking his name not just once, but twice.— Linus “Father
