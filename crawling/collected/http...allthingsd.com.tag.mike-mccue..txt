Say Hello Speaker Mike McCue CEOFlipboard There is no question that Flipboard
made a big splash when it debuted, with a hand- some and slick interface for
consuming social media on the Apple iPad, created by one of Silicon Valley's
most reliable entrepreneurs. While we'll ask McCue the story behind
Flipboard's meteoric rise, he now must answer questions about the start-up's
scalability and approach to outperforming the growing competition. Previously,
he founded Tellme Networks in 1999, and then joined Microsoft as the General
Manager of the Tellme subsidiary. Before that, McCue worked at Netscape as
Vice President of Technoloy. He joined the famed browser company after its
acquisition of the first company he founded, Paper Software, a leader in 3-D
browser technology. Posts With Mike McCue Exclusive: Flipboard Raises $50
