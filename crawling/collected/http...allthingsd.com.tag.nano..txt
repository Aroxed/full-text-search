smartphones running Android. Sources who’ve seen a prototype of this
iPhone…Nano tell Bloomberg that it’s about one-third smaller than the iPhone 4

to a Universal SIM–if it decides to release it at all. PayPal Hires VP of

Apple's New Ping Music Social Network: "Onerous Terms" Kara Swisher in News on
September 2, 2010 at 3:05 am PT Yesterday, at the Apple music event in San
Francisco, I had a short chat with Apple CEO Steve Jobs about its new social
music service, called Ping. Essentially, it is a vertical version–in this case
for music–of Facebook. But, except for Apple borrowing the blue color scheme
from the powerful social networking site, Facebook is nowhere on Ping. So,
Jobs explained why. Voices Indian Firms Shift Focus to the Poor Eric Bellman,

Point of Apple Event: Upgraded CEO John Paczkowski in News on September 10,
2009 at 5:10 am PT After nearly a year out of the public eye, Apple CEO Steve
Jobs returned to it yesterday at the company’s annual music event. It was his
first public appearance at an Apple gathering since Oct. 14, 2008, when he
uncrated the company’s new unibody MacBooks, and it far overshadowed the new
products he was about to announce. In fact, it could be argued that public
confirmation of Jobs’s health since his return to the company was truly the
most significant announcement of the day. "Hummer of Cellphones" a Bestseller
at AT&T; John Paczkowski in News on September 8, 2009 at 8:15 am PT Apple’s
iPhone continues to be AT&T;’s marquee handset, though the data-guzzling

widespread customer dissatisfaction with the carrier’s network. Indeed,
according to Piper Jaffray, the iPhone 3G and 3GS are AT&T;’s top-selling
phones. And Lo, Jobs Appeared and Said "No, This Is the Best iPod Ever," and
It Was, and There Was Much Rejoicing John Paczkowski in Social on September 8,
2009 at 6:37 am PT When Steve Jobs described the iPhone at D5 as “the best
iPod we’ve ever made,” he set the bar high for future iterations of the iconic
device. Now, in the run-up to tomorrow’s invitation-only Apple event, the
question is: Will Apple reach the bar? And with what? The answer, if the
latest rumors prove true, depends on your feelings about iPods with cameras.
