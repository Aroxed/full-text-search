Another $17.5 Million Eric Johnson in News on October 29, 2013 at 6:30 am PT
Free-to-play mobile and online game developer Rumble Entertainment has raised
$17.5 million in a Series B round led by Nexon, the company announced today.
That brings its total funding to more than $35 million. Tokyo-based Nexon was
a previous Rumble investor, and last month kicked in an undisclosed amount
toward ex-Zynga COO John Schappert’s Shiver Entertainment. Rumble’s first
game, the RPG Kings Road, launched as a browser game earlier this year, and is
planned for a worldwide tablet release in early 2014, a company spokesperson
said. A Handy Guide to Deleting Digital Accounts Lauren Goode in Product

Relaunches as Full-Fledged Online Marketplace Lauren Goode in Commerce on May
1, 2013 at 4:00 am PT OpenSky, the two-year-old e-commerce site that took a
stab at social shopping by allowing members to follow celebrity and expert
curators, has relaunched as a full-fledged marketplace for small businesses.
Merchants can open up their own “stores” on the site for free, and can sell to
OpenSky’s 2.5 million members, with OpenSky taking a commission on items sold
— like Etsy, but with a social twist, more established sellers and a much
smaller community of shoppers. Items listed range from cosmetics to clothing
to kitchen supplies. OpenSky is based in New York and has raised nearly $50
million in venture capital funding to date. Netflix, Redbox and More: What You
