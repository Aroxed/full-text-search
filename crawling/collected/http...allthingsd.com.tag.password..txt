PasswordBox, a Montreal-based company that makes password-management services
and apps for consumers, has raised $6 million in Series A funding led by Omers
Ventures and including angel investors such as Boku CEO Mark Britto and

Flaw Discovered in Tumblr iOS App Mike Isaac in Mobile on July 16, 2013 at
10:21 pm PT Tumblr, the massive Web-blogging network acquired by Yahoo earlier

application that “allowed passwords to be compromised in certain
circumstances.” The company released an update to the app, available through
the App Store, and urged all iOS users to update their passwords immediately.
Outside of saying the password could be “sniffed in certain versions of the
app,” Tumblr staff did not give further details on the nature of the security
flaw. LivingSocial Hack Update: Investigation Ongoing, While Emails Out to 50
