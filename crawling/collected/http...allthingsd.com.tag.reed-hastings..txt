AllThingsD Signs Off in 3 … 2 … 1 … Tech and media bigs on the red-hot seat.
Kara Swisher in News December 31, 2013 at 12:24 pm PT Co-Founder and
CEONetflix, Inc. Hastings co-founded Netflix as a DVD rental-by-mail company
in 1997. In 2002, Netflix went public, and in 2003, Netflix reached 1 million
subscribers. Thanks to streaming content over the Internet, Netflix now has
over 20 million subscribers. Earlier in his career, in 1991, he founded Pure
Software, which made tools for Unix software developers. He built Pure into
one of the world's 50 largest public software companies before selling it to
Rational Software in 1997. Reed received a BA from Bowdoin College and an MSCS
in AI degree from Stanford University. Between Bowdoin and Stanford, Reed
served in the Peace Corps as a high school math teacher in Swaziland. That may
have been an easier task than his current one: dealing with media and cable
companies who fear disruptive change. Posts With Reed Hastings Netflix Won’t
