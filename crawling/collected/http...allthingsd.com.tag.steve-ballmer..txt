Say Hello Speaker Steve Ballmer CEOMicrosoft Ballmer is CEO of Microsoft
Corporation, the world's leading manufacturer of software for personal and
business computing. He joined Microsoft in 1980, the first business manager
hired by his former classmate at Harvard, Bill Gates. Variously described as
ebullient, focused, hard-charging and energetic, Ballmer grew up near Detroit,
where his father worked as a manager at Ford Motor Co. After Harvard, he
worked for two years at Procter & Gamble, as an assistant product manager,
after which he attended the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.
He did not create a startup in his garage while there, but he has done well
nonetheless. Posts With Steve Ballmer Tech Stocks Hover Near 2013 Highs,
