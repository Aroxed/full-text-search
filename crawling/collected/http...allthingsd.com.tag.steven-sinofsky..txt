Returning to D is Steven Sinofsky, who left Microsoft earlier this year after
running its flagship Windows franchise. (In fact, he demoed Windows 8 onstage
in 2011.) As one of the software giant’s most high-profile execs, Sinofsky has
always had a keen view of the entire tech landscape beyond Redmond. Sinofsky
spent 23 years at Microsoft, where he managed the creation of Windows 8 and
Surface, led development for Windows 7, and held various engineering and
general management positions for ￼Microsoft Office. He also worked as Bill
Gates’s technical assistant and, with co-author Marco Iansiti, wrote “One
Strategy: Organization, Planning, and Decision Making.” He is now ensconced at
Harvard Business School, and maintains a tech and management-focused blog
called “Learning by Shipping.” Posts With Steven Sinofsky Another Longtime
