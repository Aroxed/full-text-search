Walt. Verizon’s 4G Network Is Windows-Only, for Now Ina Fried in Mobile on
December 1, 2010 at 7:45 pm PT Those who want to be among the first to rule

America, seat 10A–up to Redmond, Wash., today to attend Microsoft’s annual
Financial Analyst Meeting, which also includes a passel of media drones like
