in News on December 19, 2013 at 11:15 am PT Today, Yahoo announced that it is
bringing back the popular Tabs feature to Yahoo Mail. Tabs, which allow you to
multitask between reading and writing emails, will begin rolling out globally
over the next few days, and can be enabled by going to View > Multitasking >
Tabs. In addition, there’s a new Preview All feature that will allow you to
see all open tabs in a grid view. The absence of Tabs was just one of many
complaints users voiced about the new Yahoo Mail, which launched in October.

Yahoo’s Communications Products Kara Swisher in News on August 28, 2013 at
12:39 am PT According to his LinkedIn profile, Jeff Bonforte has been named
SVP of communication products at Yahoo. An insider tipped me to the new title
for the former CEO of Xobni, the maker of address-book apps and plugins which
Yahoo bought in July. “I have responsibility for Yahoo Mail, Messenger,
Groups, Contacts, Calendar and some other stuff,” wrote Bonforte on his
profile helpfully (to me!). AllThingsD had previously reported that the well-
regarded former Yahoo was likely to get just this key portfolio at Yahoo,
which could certainly use his expertise. In New Challenge to Dropbox and Box,
