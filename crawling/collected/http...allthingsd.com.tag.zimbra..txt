Incomplete Kara Swisher in News on January 25, 2010 at 9:24 am PT Sorry for

But BoomTown was swanning around the Sundance Film Festival in Utah this
weekend, went partying with those boozy Hollywood types and ended up in Provo
with the crazy gals from “The Runaways”! I wish! Actually, running away from
issuing any grade for deal-making for Bartz is a pretty good way to put it.
Because today, after much thought, I have to give the Yahoo leader an
incomplete for deal-making. As BoomTown Said: VMware Buys Zimbra From Yahoo
