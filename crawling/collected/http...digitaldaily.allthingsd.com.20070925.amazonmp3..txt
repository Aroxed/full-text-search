Share to Be Recorded in Apple Lossless September 25, 2007 at 9:14 am PT Tweet
Share Print Apple’s not going to turn iTunes into the Microsoft Windows of the
digital music space if Amazon can help it. This morning the retailer announced
the public beta of its much-anticipated music download service, breathlessly
touting it as “the world’s biggest selection of a la carte DRM-free MP3 music
downloads.” Amazon MP3, as the company’s cleverly named it, offers more than
two million songs from 180,000 artists and over 20,000 major and independent
labels, all of them in DRM-free MP3 format. Songs are digitized at 256
kilobits per second and cost between 89 cents and 99 cents per track–a bit
less than their iTunes Plus doppelgangers, which Apple has been peddling for
$1.29 each. That said, songs purchased from Amazon MP3, unlike those purchased
from iTunes, can only be downloaded once. If they’re subsequently deleted or
lost because of a system or disk error, Amazon won’t replace them free of
charge. You’ve got to buy them all over again. Just like a CD … Anyway … With
Sony and Virgin Digital both shuttering their online music offerings and Yahoo
Music reportedly considering the shutdown of one or more of its subscription-
based services, Amazon MP3 seems to be launching at a particularly opportune
time. And given Amazon’s retail market power, it will likely do well. But well
enough to pose a credible threat to iTunes? Consensus among industry observers
seems to be no. Says hypebot: The Amazon MP3 Download Store IS NOT: The iTunes
killer. Serious competition yes. Killer no. Too many people are used to the
iTunes-to-iPod experience no matter how easy Amazon makes it.” Tagged with:
