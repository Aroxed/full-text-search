@JohnPaczkowski Recent Posts by John Paczkowski iTunes: Thanks 5 Billion June
19, 2008 at 7:35 am PT Tweet Share Print Apple’s (AAPL) iTunes digital media
store has now sold more than 5 billion songs since its 2001 debut. And with
downloads of digital movies having reached 50,000 a day, Apple says the
service has become the leading purveyor of online music and videos. What’s
more, it’s now the largest music retailer in the states. Which means it’s
bested Wal-Mart (WMT) for the top music-retailer spot. Apple offered up this
news with a bit of a reality-distorted caveat, though. The latest NPD Group
data on which its claims are based was culled from the research outfit’s
MusicWatch survey, which counts one CD as representing 12 tracks. As of this
writing Wal-Mart’s list of 10 top-selling CDs includes many that feature more
than 12 tracks–some with more than 20, and one that boasts more than 35.
