relatively tame product announcements and the absence of Steve Jobs, Apple’s
(AAPL) final Macworld keynote wasn’t without a highpoint or two: changes in
pricing and digital rights management for the iTunes store, a new 17-inch
MacBook Pro with an eight-hour battery life, and a surprise appearance by
crooner Tony Bennett, among them. Below: the event in pictures, courtesy of
ATD’s crack photojournalist, Adam Tow. Click any photo to launch a slideshow.
