Recent Posts by Arik Hesseldahl Microsoft Suit Against Salesforce Just Got
Ugly February 11, 2011 at 3:41 pm PT Tweet Share Print Last month, Microsoft
sued Salesforce.com over the latter’s hiring of Matt Miszewski. Once the CIO
for the state of Wisconsin, he had most recently been head of Microsoft’s
government business, and on Jan. 18 was tapped as senior vice president for
global public sales at Salesforce. Microsoft sued to block the hiring less
than 10 days later. The court issued a temporary injunction preventing
Miszewski from going to work at Salesforce. It just got ugly. Microsoft has
accused Miszewski (pictured) of taking several hundred megabytes worth of
confidential material when he left. It said in a motion filed with Washington
state’s King County Superior Court on Thursday that Miszewski had about 600
megabytes worth of confidential material on his personal computer. The
documents were found as part of the discovery process. Microsoft Dynamics
Online competes directly with Salesforce.com in the cloud-based customer
relationship management business. They grappled in federal court last year
over patents, but settled. Neither side is commenting on the Miszewski case.
