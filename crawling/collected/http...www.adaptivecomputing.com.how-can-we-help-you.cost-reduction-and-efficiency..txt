Reduction and EfficiencyCost Reduction and Efficiency Cost Management and
Capacity Planning Cost reduction and efficiency help an organization re-invest
their resources and saved funds into achieving higher results, profits or
competitiveness. Efficiency/savings can be achieved by improving utilization,
processes, or behavior associated with resource usage. The following are
examples of capabilities, which contribute to cost reduction and efficiency:
Multi-Cluster Workload Management Utilize Excess Capacity of Multiple Clusters
Share excess capacity on multiple clusters through consolidating them under a
single workload manager. Grids enable users, groups and projects to more
easily share resources and data. Auto-scale Temporary Capacity Avoid Unneeded
Asset Purchases by Auto-scaling your Cluster using Elastic Computing Elastic
Computing allows Moab Cloud HPC Suite to add or remove resources from either a
local resource pool, public/private remote resource pool or from within a
shared cluster. This capability includes Moab Cloud monitoring wait times for
workload and then triggering OpenStack, VMWare, HP-CMU, Bright Cluster
Manager, other provisioning tools or Cloud APIs (Amazon, etc.) to provision
additional resources to be under the workload manager’s control. Advanced
Resource Management Maintain Resource Efficiency on Heterogeneous Clusters As
clusters are scaled up to meet the needs of multiple groups, inevitably the
application requirements of those groups require different resource
configurations to optimize their application performance. Moab Cloud’s
Advanced Resource Management capabilities add Node Allocation Policies, Node
Set resource groupings, NUMA, and other policies which help maintain efficient
utilization in heterogeneous resource environments. Usage Accounting and
Chargeback/Showback Improve Resource Usage Efficiency As users and
organizations receive feedback about their usage or even get charged for it,
their usage behavior inevitably changes to drive improved overall efficiency.
Accounting Manager is a fast, easy-to-use accounting management system that
allows showback and chargeback for usage tracking and charging for resource or
service usage in virtually any computing environments. Power Optimization
Reduce Costs by Optimizing Power Usage with Power Management / Green Computing
Moab Cloud is able to reduce the power state of idle nodes in order to reclaim
unnecessary energy usage. It can also manage power utilized on a per-
application basis using clock speed and P-state management. NUMA Accelerate
Job Performance with Efficient Memory to Core Matching Proper NUMA-aware
placement of a job can improve run-time by as much as 250 percent due to
better memory access and can improve GPU data transfer by as much as 300
percent. Workflow Management Improve Administrator and End User Efficiency by
Automating Tasks Workflow management is an important capability which helps to
automate both end-to-end workload and system processes. This eliminates manual
intervention, thereby speeding processes and eliminating potential errors.
