of Corporate Performance to Lead Business Initiatives Increased Visibility
Into Data Enables Quicker, More Strategic Decision-Making English English,
British – ANZ Tabs and spreadsheets only go so far in painting a comprehensive
financial picture. At Specsavers, multiple “Excel silos” were blocking
visibility into making data-driven decisions. The lack of collaboration
created a lengthy consolidation process prone to manual input errors. The
U.K.-based optical retailer turned to cloud-based software for improved
budgeting, tighter reporting turnaround, and seamless data source integration.
Adaptive Planning met those needs and more, giving Specsavers new eyes on the
retail landscape. Challenges Living in a world of "Excel silos" with lack of
collaboration across management teams Lengthy consolidation process prone to
manual errors Inadequate budget version control Results Automated monthly
reporting and what-if scenario modeling for decisions on hiring and
investments in the business Corporate-wide planning accelerated by 50% Self-
service financial reporting provides executives better visibility of what’s
happening to make quicker, more strategic business decisions DOWNLOAD CASE

Using spreadsheets to manage its budgeting and business planning, Specsavers
faced a lack of collaboration across management teams in more than one hundred
cost centers. Consolidating data into a single overall budget was not only
time-consuming, it was often prone to human error. With the company’s plans to
expand, such problems were only set to get worse. "We were living in a world
of Excel silos," said Matt Buckley, group planning and reporting lead for
finance at Specsavers. "Budgeting and planning had become a version control
nightmare among numerous stakeholders and contributors, and inaccuracies
increasingly threatened to throw business goals off course. We were in
desperate need of a single version of the truth on which we could base current
and future budgeting decisions." Leaping to the Cloud "Adaptive Planning
alleviated any fears in our leap to the cloud," continued Buckley. "It was
quick to deploy and has the look and feel of Excel, but the power and
analytical capabilities of a much more sophisticated solution. It’s helping us
produce error free, standardized versions of our budgets, forecasts, and
financial reporting that helps us make decisions with confidence in the data."
An Empowered Finance Team Making an Impact on Business Decisions Adaptive
Planning has allowed Specsavers to allocate budget far more simply and
efficiently; reducing any unnecessary costs and minimising the hours spent
correlating data from different cost centers. Planning has been accelerated by
50 percent, thanks to automated aggregation and pre-population of planning
sheets with data from the company’s general ledger and ERP systems. Today,
Specsavers generates monthly tailored reports and models complex ‘what-if’
scenarios within Adaptive Planning for decisions on hiring and making new
investments in the business. Specsavers can easily understand the financial
impact of potential new FTE’s and can quickly flow through the impact of
varying retail performances to the bottom line. With Adaptive, Specsavers has
automated its variance analysis and monthly retailing KPI reporting. "By
holding our retail data and KPI’s within a robust application instead of
across multiple spreadsheets, we have easy access to one version of the truth
that has become the go to database for reporting this information," Buckley
explained. Furthermore, the detailed reporting means that Specsavers has a
reliable audit trail. Self-service financial reporting has been quickly
utilized by the most senior decision makers within Specsavers. All of the
executives have simultaneous and instant access to the very latest financial
information and forecasts, giving them better visibility of what’s happening
across the organisation to make quicker, more strategic business decisions.
"Adaptive Planning offers Specsavers visibility into all of our key
performance metrics all through a single pane of glass. We can rest assured
that this information is both accurate and up-to-date, which is vital when
we’re planning and making predictions," continued Buckley. "Anyone who has
spent time and effort trawling through Excel spreadsheets, never quite
achieving the perfect final picture, would greet the ease and insight afforded
by Adaptive Planning with open arms. It has allowed us to drive discussions
based on a single view of the entire business, giving us the historic picture
that allows us to look forward based on real trends, proving that the entire
business can now benefit from a more collaborative, better informed and
empowered finance team. It has allowed us to drive discussions based on a
