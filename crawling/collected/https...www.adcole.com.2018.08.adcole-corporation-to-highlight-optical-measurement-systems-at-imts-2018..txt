Optical Measurement Systems at IMTS 2018 By Adcole August 28, 2018 News No
Comments 1 0 0 MARLBOROUGH, MA August 28, 2018 — Adcole Corporation today
announced that it will be displaying two new optical measurement systems at
IMTS 2018, to be held at McCormick Place, Chicago, from September 10-15, 2018.
Adcole plans to show the company’s new LightSCOPE™ and LightSCAN™ optical
measurement systems. These optical systems will be fitted into two Cylindrical
Coordinate Measurement Machines (CCMMs) at the show, the Model 911 and
1200-LX, two of Adcole’s flagship products. Both of these optical measurement
systems benefit advanced manufacturing operations with high speed scanning of
complex camshaft and crankshaft parts, and deliver extremely accurate non-
contact measurement data in a shop floor ready configuration. The Model 911
and Model 1200-LX CCMM Gages in which the optical systems are fitted to are
regarded as the workhorses of the industry. The Model 911 flexible vertical
gage is ideal for measuring camshafts, pistons, pump rotors/housings,
transmission shafts and many other cylindrical components. The 1200-LX is a
high-precision gage that uses a laser interferometer system for precise
follower positioning to measure crankshafts, camshafts, and other large
cylindrical components in demanding production environments. Simple to
operate, with comprehensive, easy-to-understand pass/fail output reports, the
Model 1200-LX helps advanced manufacturers verify part tolerances, minimize
scrap, and eliminate quality breaches. Both gages are programmable for
automated measurement sequences, are equipped with an accurate headstock
spindle that has a runout of less than 0.1 µm, both feature an intuitive user
interface with touchscreen monitor, and deliver 3,600 data points per
revolution (every 1/10 of a degree). “The LightSCOPE and LightSCAN optical
measurement systems add a tremendous amount of speed and flexibility to your
metrology process. By integrating these optical measurement systems into the
best CCMMs in the business, manufacturers stand to gain a significant quality
edge,” states Jeff Walker, President and CEO, Adcole Corporation. “These
innovative and flexible non-contact measurement systems will serve the needs
of forward-thinking customers looking to reduce the time and costs associated
with comprehensive metrology.” The Model 911 LightSCOPE system offers fast,
accurate scanning capabilities for complex camshaft metrology tasks. To see
the LightSCOPE and LightSCAN optical measurement systems in action on the
Model 911 and Model 1200LX Gages, please visit Adcole at Booth #121139, in the
East Building of McCormick Place, Level 2. About Adcole Corporation Founded in
