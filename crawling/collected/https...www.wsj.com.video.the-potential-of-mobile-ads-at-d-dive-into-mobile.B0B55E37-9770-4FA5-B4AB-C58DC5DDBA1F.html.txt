100% accurate.... the ... Spiro for Google ... and all is the one for
Millennial Media ... so ... and ... the law ... yes ... besides he ... was
sure we ought to know ... when ... now where an announcement that ... um ...
so what I read about media and advertising in the train every day and so you
write enough stories he does see patterns developing over the years ... so
every six or nine months of this truth the same headlines says ... of mobile
ads growing very fast ... still pretty small ... um sorrow one of those last
summer last fall was based on a Nikkei report that said ... I think halfway
through the year mobile ads in the U S weren't in the one point two billion
... Solus project that out and say it's a three or four billion dollar
business last year in the US ... big number but it's me the seven something in
the single did percent of total ... Internet advertising which is a smaller
subset of total advertising ... since two thousand thirteen with all that
really awesome groans over one's got a phone ... been talking a month ago will
add them for a long time so ... was to start there when when is the boom going
to show up in NY hasn't come yet ... me who was the first Jason I know I can
start by first looking for it ... I think we're very much in it because it
centers on the consumer ... it starts from what you said which is the phones
that we all have ... phones that we'll use in the way that we use ... aam I
think that ... what falls consumer behavior is of the attention of marketers
and we certainly have the attention of marketers ... are spending their time I
think what's between us and the ... growth in the percentage of dollars that
you're looking for I think a lot of people are looking for ... op is a couple
fundamental facts and briefly on the first one is ... on the observation
models we know that this is changing behavior we know that people are ... are
engaging with the ads and find their way into stores and turned it into the
ads are making phone calls ... I debated on duration during hegemony as the
starting on one device ... and moving back and forth between devices to route
today ... and the sort of multi device were pockets of fundamentally we need
to get a track that that's where the values in ... the second thing is and I
think this was said earlier ... obviously we have to stop trying to warn the
desktop metaphor into mobile ... we have to think about what people want one
are on the go live to offer the most experience which means about the peach
way to the page load time ... it also means about catering to what we what we
were on the go ... and I think then you see ... the natural evolution of
consumer behavior ... marketers attention at all the budget that well so will
bring some of them is to govern alone only in from the top in motion stir by
saying ... the relatively new to mobile ads but you can see see advertising
unit for one times to get ... a good perspective on ... what's working on a
desktop and what hasn't shown pure ... Oval ... I think that the same thing
happen an on line everybody said Lynas could be the Yarrow bomb lying ... and
also that sneaks up and its arty there so I agree with Jason that ... we're
seeing tremendous growth in your starting from a smaller piece but ... the
growth is really there in your meeting with Sienna is your meeting with the
had a ... big agencies scale are allocating more and more and more of their
budgets to mobile ... and so I think it's it's an evolution I don't think all
this that he'll wake up and saying oh that this day arrives ... I aam but it's
can it be because of these things more education and ... more comfort it's a
new medium ... so ... I New Media makes people not wanna just go and uh
hundred percent people wanna pass the market's against two thousand thirteen
It's that the I phone since two thousandseven ... um ... been around for while
mummy mummy mummy shrink the size the market a bit more too because is this
works well for Jason Ng doable right that ... half of that mobile numbers
search right to choose people taking search ads and moving your phone right so
that ... I would even argue that ... the PC mobile ads but it's not really
what people were thinking about when they were ... recently talking mum will
last ... um think I found it yet please the reform of the beginning in the
energy to ... get there ... I think if I would say that there are certainly
people who are shoe morning who are bringing their search and display ads
across from elsewhere for this one I would say both that the budget level the
creative level ... and the goals level before like to protect your all this
went very heavily mobile specific ... I never demanding of us to the people
that spend the money ... are are are are holding the defenders of people that
sell them ... at media accountable immobile specifically I don't think that
many ... hybrid multiplatform out there just order ... slipping into right I
guess I would say that I mean I think people thought moves concert there was a
conception of what mobile advertising was gonna be a few years ago was this
... story we all repeated over and over you'd walk by a Starbucks for since
Mr. Rudd to guillotine Peter please come by coffee for me it's ... it's half
of it ... for your from the one that ... is that um so one thing we haven't
seen this most partisan is any that location specific stuff ... um I keep
hearing about it but we see examples of a scheme to get the same mobile ad no
matter where you were on vacation during the summer retreats are ... this week
is that you divvy organ locations in itself but it seems like that's lagged
... what can I missing something there ... we are guessing ... that ... yes I
think that vocation is one of those data points ... that's part of ... the
majority of the campaigns that we are on the millennial ... and it's so
important because it's not just ... the ALM that one data point that you're in
front of the Starbucks ... it's what content or yuan do we know that you're
there at the same time everyday so that you're probably on your way to work
and what would be relevant EU ... ayam but mobile and the location piece ...
for advertisers is usually important but it's not just ... buying area it's
not just enough like a billboard ... it's it's more than ... searching for me
the difference for the challenge of a Starbuck example is push versus full ...
time for me I agree completely Molly is they ... give you a couple of examples
that ... we enable people think you'd use well to target based on semantic
location so we have the ... ability to target people were airports are people
who weren't with his mystical addition said it is something as inane
suppressed ... laughter lot to say you know that because I say I'm in an
airport or noses or uses GPS is the location is your inner border near ... um
... we haven't mapping out there honestly after today many people at mass ...
but but there are mapping of the somewhat Long's that we know that sports
stadium or we know that ... an airport and now for the hospitality industry is
exempt for the rental car industry ... but very very valuable time to reach
someone when you pair it with context and understanding about Avici when you
have the intent of search ... aam what a layer on top of that you said
location as it happens when things I'm most excited about ... are we enable
people to be a based on proximity ... to so to draw a radius around a retail
establishment are quick serve restaurant ... for an airport or whatever does
this say ... some was within that distance you know ... that I define hundred
meters or ten meters ... up ... with in the distance of that retail
establishment or whatever it is ... I wanted to provide it ... write to the
south with the surgery balance I think you or start your location ... I think
you are start her new Burton owns presentation earlier ... reactor time
provide relevant information along to read ... I think that ... and again if
you haven't seen them we will share ... trading ... um I'm doing are more
examples as you're talking about that specific on a location for a ride on one
hand it sounds really great this is the can on the other hand I think of what
was hers eventually creepy and it's a violation of my privacy ... um and
frightened ... prices of the Bugaboo for all kinds of Web advertising right
now ... Quito colluded bouts of Kinder skating ... on that line right you want
provide as much precise information tear to your clients ... without freaking
out people like me your fault Oscar ... well I think the consumer in the days
and control all of a lot of that year ... give your location services on ...
then ... you know ... that you're going you're going to be emitting a signal
for your app store for what not ... though the news and what I think about it
because of that my phone will tell me where I need to be no phone so
advertisers for ... both things are happening right now may not be aware of
the ladder ... well I think they hear each year getting ... most of your apps
for furry and there's a reason you're getting less severe apps for free ...
and so it's part of that whole ... ion ... content given take that happens
between advertisers and publishers are ready to get the consumers are
cognizant of that specific weren't were a little more conservative in ... its
are different in first party virus or partly on Google properties ... if for
providing utility based on location so it were using location to get a better
search results ... or give you more relevant YouTube video or giddy about this
play out on the Gap ... Ben weasel comparable and when he described ... using
a location that to improve the relevance of the app ... in third party
apartments which may be an app that meal serotonin operate ... then we think
it's about making sure that people have the ability of that size you describe
... yes your GPS is on you understand that that food spotting out for whatever
the heck it is ... is to search needs you also should always have the ability
to understand what's being used and out of the day ticker ... do think ... it
behooves three cents about the stuff the stuff that you guys might be doing if
you have the ability to politically but you want to ... tread a little more
carefully than the publisher much ... search tomorrow I think Erica Altly
better suited to answer some about what I would say is ... I'm ... I think
that there's there's ... work just understand all the signals are we have on
these devices and and I would absolutely say that ... there's things I think
we talk publicly about facial recognition a lot of things ... were like
anything is across all ... are and where we've made a decision not to use them
to me know that other companies will be may be more aggressive with this ...
we hold ourselves to stand so yes there are plenty of things that we can do
... where we stop short walk from UGG say well we can get within a meter of
you were going to do with ten meters or a hundred meters Wieser of ... deliver
listen to put in one arm behind her to marketing ... um I don't remember
specific examples of that where we talk about superstition a GPS to not take
an example ... buy things they did it comes it all comes back to cancer
experience and ... if we are delivering a better utility we are to live in a
better consumer trends ... we feel we can hear atop a list ... of better ad
relevance ... and they get the expected ... it ... Mercer a privacy issue the
talks alot about what I'm on the desktop web is is targeting Indian cookies
are returning and cookies ... um I hope the connection cannot turn the muscles
and added that it is understood that ... there's a lot of concern and five
because ... existing web publishing industry that cookies are gonna go way the
bonus track your movement over the web is going to go away ... is a big part
of the Web ad business it built on that idea this isn't what the circuit the
following five sites ... in the one Supreme an ad based on that ... you guys
can do that at all ... it um ... can is no cookies on mobile ... you may even
face some I missing something ... on a new pre read a book called I'm not here
to sell cookies to people that I'm ... there are cookies on a mobile app and
there are ways of recognizing users better service or idea to enter any number
of things ... that are generally understood to be ... economical ways of doing
... how that is after changes in how you get the ball when ... I'm out what
the store a lot of things is where I think we're very concerned with the
distinction of a missing the mantle to my education from ... other people here
... um ... when people sit there and you can't do cookies on on on mobile
phones when they ... were they say Molly nothing ... much left after a long
... known enough that ... I am I think that it's all about user identification
writes here's a few different things and we know who you are based in future
phone has a ninety ... purses we know we were base we know what you've been
doing on your fungus can track ... individual web pages that to write this
difference ... and I ... know I think I think that the corporate there's
different technologies the web and relatives for happened box right I think
the angle is beginning Friday Sept Privacy centric way with respect EPI
respecting the ways of restoring his location ... is you don't deliver that
better experience we talked about ... I think if the sensuous on talk of the
technology ... we miss the fact that there's all these new signals in mobile
Frank Brenda's were categorized the stuff that you can view on ... the stop
way that you cannot do on your phone with you guys are saying we can replace
that with other and at the movie rights ... I've I've ... I personally feel a
... because of the different signals and the different user identification
that's possible ... and mobile ... that mobile has the opportunity to set the
standards are we set the standard ... and so the conversation around cookies
... I think people have this particular are I in age in their mind when it
comes to cookies on line ... and I think it just comes back to ... the user
identification protecting privacy ... what are people really trying to do and
I think with mobile there's more of an opportunity per to protect privacy ...
but also Privee unit using technology treat more relevant ... experiences for
consumers can I can talk but they didn't trade on Friday to one of things
we're talking white cookies are so important ... if you want to build a
profile you understand somebody is in the market for car they go to the movies
very often and it isn't certain types of things ... but now replace that in a
mobile contact ... with the idea that we're all multi device were always going
back and forth in these devices ... there's a certain set of devices and
contacts where we are out and about forward in the physical world around us
... for interacting with retell establishment or interacting with ...
everything that we spend our days doing what all of you are doing right now
one are planning what happens for dinner ... Frank ... pouring gauging the
physical world and our location has very very powerful thing to that ... time
of day is very very powerful ... as well as what your near and things are
working time and all these advancements that you can use yet really do
position targeting ... due to buy into the buyers have the capability do this
stuff and scale are saying we can now put together some was that we can put to
work immediately ... we've got the stuff we actually want to apply this right
now ... it seems like very often um some that how it's available for ...
digital ads in general is an adopted by the body ... we made a very big ...
change in the way we do AdWords which is both for search and it's by an extra
minute in ... awe in February this year were we actually put forth by when it
does takes all the complex the out of what were talkin ... so you can think
about a multi device user because ... we all meter Brell chases consumer who
goes back and forth between her devices throughout the day ... and he told
community that I would say there's a before after for odds and assertive two
thousand twelve ... with a bunch of different things to work on how to get out
that ... announ two thousand thirteen I think we finally built a tool ... to
enable people to actually think multi screen ... and think about location
oneness with out how to build ... up ... too much on her ... what's more
things I think a bottle of wine in ... one way people consume media to talk
about in consuming and mobile devices is ... one piece in the mobile means on
the go right ... but ... it's part of posts from ESPN the baton of human
happens ... on the couch and some on the phone or laptop and ... began or your
... or your buyers and we want to distinguish between someone who's at the
office someone is on the road for some reason the company asking that
specificity yet ... yes absolutely get a distinctly this ran a campaign ...
aam with National Geographic because they want it ... to dry campaign on
tablets of the same time ... a show they are doing on Lincoln was airing so
this simultaneous viewing ... is hugely powerful um I think your Tennessee
more and more advertisers ask for that take the ... opportunity and measure
minute tracking that goes along with it ... but they saw some of the highest
lakes of a aam ... of of viewership ... on the tablet and knowing that people
were watching the show this was in the second screen and write pages water on
ads do is just running ads ... for the ... I think is it for me we talked
about mobile for so long as a medieval term still uses book every as a device
that specific piece of artwork ... will share the planet doesn't change my
mind dramatically because I now see mobile as a context ... thank you describe
... a context on the couch worsened using a smartphone or tablet ... for me
that ... smartphone or tablet used on the couch in the evening has more in
common with a ... dust up with a laptop isn't an exact same environment ... in
the smartphone has in common with ... ice for use in a cafe lunch ... and so
are starting to see is the actual form factors not the strongest signal ...
the actual shape of the device and a networking connection is no wonder the
best way to capture someone who's on the go ... because we are using our ...
smartphones at home on the couch while watching TV ... I ... we are your
tablets in Cafe in bonds ... and a lot of our premium why ... we can take me
to Cafe in harmony with us on our commute ... so we're actually putting some
of these other context head of ... the form factor head of the device ... when
we talk about relevance so for me ... mobile is becoming a context rather than
terms ... um ... when ... you were talking about this increasing amount of
money to pay whatever speed is coming in at ... rates of its overall a good
thing for people like you guys ... others debate going on for publishers about
what this means for them ... um a lot of them are saying that their audience
is moving to mobile either its additive or their existing eyeballs are moving
on to mobile devices ... and then a lot of then depending on how truthful or
the matrix that ... whatever's going on will say and yet we're not getting the
same amount of money for mobile of eyeballs in the weather the gap right
anywhere from twenty percent depending on how many troops you have ... why is
that I is there a gap it seems like ... if you wanna say what they were not
getting as many dollars move in the market is reply still Shmuel detergent
least ... equivalent amounts of money for those mobile so so what gives ... we
totally into it ... sites selling the area and a ... half I think that a word
until a miss is that we're going to be eighty percent loss I think that
sometimes it's it's coming from this test mentality ... I don't think they're
still testing I think the sun doesn't there are some people who are still ...
testing ... and it's becoming more more mainstream or you know I aam mandatory
that mobile is is part of the marketing budget ... I aam when the media's and
... I aam ... but I I I also know for fact that there are a lot the mobile ad
units that are higher CPM than ALM ... and it's those are along the lines of
the DIA when some of the created things that you can do ... on mobile whether
to smartphone art Ablin or whatever ... contextual to buy ... it ... she's run
window and I and and ... and ... and and and so we're seeing higher straight
out here that video is the answer this that's close to him but it's also the
rich media it's that you know sleeping impacted your tapping and all sorts of
the mobile cool times ... are seeing higher exemption rates per mobile to
fines ... then we are then ... uptrend efforts on its ... so I think there are
Metrix and there are pricing models that are actually hired ... by a win when
you're talking about that errors ... I would say that is lower price and I
don't have a good reason I think it's education ... and I think ... you know
that's discuss the change because it is this really makes for good and ... and
and I think our case we do see lower prices I and I dislike him but all you
see lower prices for The aka and we believe that you know especially when
you're talking auctions been in CPM Reserve meeting quell Pieper paying for
value ... ahh and can contribute and track the value of their talk of his
watch for ... and until you can show them ... we can certainly show them brand
after recently Shaw lot of those types of things ... that you can show the
person who sees the add ... on using gnomes example walks into a Taco Bell ...
write ... until you can show that experience which ... again were moving
toward very quickly I know that people are investing in swell ... they can
show that they're not going to pay as much for ... right ... and as people
learn about mobile we think is education ... we think it is after the Asian
investment from the doctrinal community ... ahh and we're investing very
heavily to help people track the value of a phone call the let's be clear does
that attribution mom loves this town on the stump whether it's ... yet Burford
rectify sever ties with direct response rate is pretty straightforward read I
see a thing of the family had to buy ... it so that's ... there's no
difference there between ... what ... desktop and mobile ... for it so you're
talking about I saw Taco Bell ... when you disagree dramatic difference of
desktop and mobile and we can get track all of the consumer ... right ... so
historically was very hard to circuitry the call handling that the call back
to ... but ... now we can be ... increasing as people move between devices
when E B of A track something to convert some of the cheaper devices tablet or
a big screen devices start somewhere else ... along the value has been created
mobile is going off in the physical world in ending up another street ...
about after the show from that ... were working artists all the others are as
well ... in a brand were which I think is where you're going ... we certainly
do all the studies I think everybody stricken to expose versus controlled
studies ... uni scalable ads are ... right today we don't have the ad serving
in the May twenty on servers ... working hard to make that work for all kinds
of media ... write anything about the consumer is moving back and forth
between these devices ... were offering all the style experience I ... I think
we can explain ... how the mobile experience ... matches or does not match
what they found us ... I don't a lot of people today they're doing ... are
free to seek out across the ... industry needs across bought from solution ...
to consumers think about their experience multi device as industry we haven't
been thinking that that ... was forming can begin testing to try to create
this ... multi screens to as the two goal is the US doesn't yet made billion
dollar run rate last fall it's not all ... mobile ads it's mostly mobile ads
has been the prominence ... of the most responsibility is to create the
standards and create this technology ... or are you unable to because if you
do with their hands as the one who global solution ... I would make a really
it's been about most responsible and I would say we have responsibility make
sure our customers can attribute the Maxim out what they're buying ... in to
work with the industry make sure that they can be scaled I think one inching
things about ... media ads and things that run and ... an Angry Birds or in
ways or in whatever it is ... are the industries in India was still standing
tall in a by this Sunday the tools to do it ... and a new standards beyond
honestly bears are specials ... Tannenbaum did ... and it did last year is
about native ads on this is the buzzword on the web in and people for sale
that's how are also an assault on mobile prop ... simple Twitter Facebook
amounts of water are ... our mobile ads are native as a network as well or
better ... on on phones and tablets is that you want on the web ... designer
human sound correct to YouTube I adapted the native as systems special ...
magic sauce when it comes to mobile ... the leading question yet as ... this
does not need of your in the business of selling native and ... recent things
that are specific to YouTube or or ... beyond ... Karen and ... I mean ...
we're a platform so that we don't own ... the apps but the on the day will
come in you say oh I wish you miss a minute that this announcement ... and we
get now ... then ... I ... was a couple of platforms of the yen ... I think
that yes I think that schools that that day I dun still wide serving networks
across publishers ... need to contemplate how to serve things in a specific
environment so that you can Sling a Ford F one fifty instead of an angry bear
... right ... on and I think you will see some of the field not meant to be
specific or literal ... aam ... but I am and ... I'm not sure that's a very
good game ... but but ... I've but I think you are seeing people search firm
in law Lisa models I think there's a place for the native out in the same if
they can charge a higher CPM a specific to them and are on ... I don't think
that in any way solve scalable prob across the entire economy ... on where you
need something that works for the agencies and marketers out there to
understand audience to understand formats and into my without weren't enough
customers ... um ... you guys want smaller portions of it due to the meeting
people in mobile advertising so what's open up the floor of the question is a
much or ... you might receive his stand up and yell and what were the only
thing between them during their ... copyrighted penalize the Fiesta inflation
and if you don't amass them one question so ... humor me ... the show ... beer
... one brave soul ... two ... their reason for ... that ... he's just staff
to identify results ... an instant like Chairman Coleman voiced ... caution
about when you talk about checking from device to voice any discounting in
summary the trustee or did their base a long and the ... Goebel plus on
multiple devices and that's what that's basically the key this year ... for
frosting answers logging ... on and doesn't answer any only Goebel plus I
think romance Part solution all that ... I'm getting certain disclose a lot
about how we're going out but I think the way the Euro spec private is making
sure people are logged and ... I know the industry is not a lot of ... of more
aggressive things ... I thought only my place that that ... the push those
buttons lot on her ship around ... are creating a ... marketing viewed is
consistent with the multi screen reality that consumers that's so a good deal
on the today show not this year and ... the thing quarterly ... to Jason are
saying that right now you guys are wonderful to watch and say ... I'm on my
and write in my towel and whatever and that's how you know her and devices ...
of the nice he said other people are selling ... solutions are saying they can
do stuff that will do that for you ... because some of you some magic algebra
calculus I guess that was the number of players that by the nature the Serbs
have people on them and and there are also third parties who are doing ...
lots of different things they're not sure about the law writes who would you
be able to get to that model where you can start contributing to Purdue is
about the sign without judging that I think we believe that law Dennis are a
lot ... petition ... well I had one question he said that some of ... the
strikes right yet ... on for so I'm curious ... will Google's support the
current ecosystem where there are ... you get SPY's demand side platforms that
are going to want to bid on inventory ... and you know who would otherwise
make available ... for so so ... sorry thingy about that ecosystem and
supporting ... mold histories ... but it did it ... I just wanna ... find ESPN
for Ariana and going home I now know when it's ... your job on the pair's
first or demand side platform is a programmatic way of buying based on ... a
particular insight ... so that insight about Peter Medidata about a set of
consumers using cookies or something else ... ahh ... and allows them to make
... it ... valuable insights in use at me in a way that others might not ...
so um they will get a better definition of that but ... I'm ... that
presumably relies on achieving expose certain identifiable information with
someone can match the problematic information they don't ... we believe the
changes are important are the mix in mobile the same way they were ... and
have been in desktop we think that enables kill Bill intellect the innovation
on the demand side blue ... I'm so you know we have at XM Admeld in that mix
and continue to invest in ... things on the questions in mobile come back to
appear was asking about which is what is that unique identifier that allows
you to match ... your data with a day this coming from a publisher for my own
and operate property ... I think frankly some of that ... is still being
worked on others and big steps recently with Idea Fe which we think ... makes
it easier to Osama ... aam but again were to be very careful ... in our
approach not that I think ... philosophically we believe India's these changes
... is does the mobile version of Chrome ... support cookies right now for
third parties ... to do their own tracking ... I think I know the answer to
that but I don't and I'm very good thing I don't know the answer about the
video card after our guests today ... great thank you ... for one last
question ... then ... there's ... the CPR Jason Molly ... Whittier it serves
favorite mobile ad campaigns that had been run recently and you can share with
the audience ... a great question on Europe ... have we just ran an awesome
campaign for Call of Duty Perak today and ... Dom in which it views the ayam
... camera functionality ... so you can actually create your own ad ... and
you can take a picture of yourself or somebody else ... and it would download
and then you actually became part of the ad ... and you can send it your Franz
posted to a spot in the it people sharing this playing ... all over the place
and it was his phenomenal engagement and that awareness that we're able to
drive the brand ... and was really fun like that ... it's really ... I'll
probably politically incorrect but my kids in the Cam Island ... he was as
high not good parenting moment but promised and promised to be the year
without a straight up I promise you that agency whoever bought that not only
talked about all the people you talk to all year and the ... only way ... so I
took two quick ones ... aam ... we drove a heckuva lot store traffic for T
Mobile using the proximity Stock UMass for example earlier someone to come
back to it ... aam they ran a campaign to target people in certain serve what
within a certain distance of my longs ... actually party driving people into
physical stores in the DVD tasked ... with different geomarkets understand
where work and where it gets about one in a very hardcore D R I wonder what
really quickly is BMW in ... aam Austria and Germany ... did a Finra they
matched up ... up aam through the virtual reality they were sitting and doing
a test ride in a car ... we can see the inside the car which would've been
cool enough on its own ... within a tick Street View ... Nadia Dili where
actually been driving the car to a destination of your choosing experiencing
... the flow of the car to drive to look out the windshield around the side
window ... you actually see yourself driving I will show you Peter squinting
at me ... aam I will show you how this it's beautiful and I think didn't cause
any accidents was ... there were no actual course were people in all that's
the can or ... cannot ... however I think that the people getting outside the
dance ... right if example of getting outside of the the shoe warning of
desktop metaphors and read what you can create one of these every time someone
has for this really mean ... the mosquitoes are treated at the things he
treated agencies to get involved a lot I Can't Stop ... but continue this
discussion sooner I don't ... know Mylan ... sister friend and he ... Up Next
